Econometrica Vol 89, No 5 (entire issue missing)
    - This is weird, this volume issue appears in both the Scopus search tool and in a tailored API call. Will have to check if its absence is due to a try-except error.
    - Replicating the journal-level API cal returns 1071 results but the CSV that Ive previously generated has almost 1700 observations... But I can't find any duplicates?
