129,4,2021-04-01,"The existing economics literature on international trade agreements focuses on tariff agreements covering trade in goods and explains core features of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Tariffs play almost no role in services markets, however, and the literature cannot account for the strikingly different approach to trade liberalization in agreements such as the World Trade Organization's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). We develop a model through which key features of GATS, including its emphasis on ""deep integration"" can be understood. And we use this model to suggest that there may also be a middle ground for services trade liberalization between the GATS deep-integration approach and the traditional ""shallow-integration"" approach of GATT.","['Sykes, Alan O.', 'Staiger, Robert W.']","['Trade Policy; International Trade Organizations', 'Empirical Studies of Trade', 'Industry Studies: Services: General']","['F13', 'F14', 'L80']",The Economic Structure of International Trade-in-Services Agreements,1,0,0,0,0,2021,04,01

Matched-sample difference-in-differences estimates show that firm size and trademark registrations increase following UPC adoption by manufacturers. Industry-level import penetration also increases with domestic UPC adoption. Our findings suggest that bar codes, scanning, and related technologies helped stimulate variety-enhancing product innovation and encourage the growth of international retail supply chains.","['Basker, Emek', 'Simcoe, Timothy']","['Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Empirical Studies of Trade', 'Multinational Firms; International Business', 'Transactional Relationships; Contracts and Reputation; Networks', 'Firm Performance: Size, Diversification, and Scope', 'Innovation and Invention: Processes and Incentives', 'Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes']","['D22', 'F14', 'F23', 'L14', 'L25', 'O31', 'O33']","Upstream, Downstream: Diffusion and Impacts of the Universal Product Code",1,0,0,1,0,2021,04,01

This paper proposes a revealed preference approach, using food consumption to uncover ethnic and religious identity choices in India. We first show that consumption of identity goods responds to forces suggested by social identity research: group status and group salience. Moreover, identity choices respond to the cost of following the group's prescribed behaviors. We propose and estimate a demand system to quantify the identity changes that followed India's 1991 reforms. While social identity research has focused on status and salience, our results suggest that economic costs also play an important role.","['Shayo, Moses', 'Colson-Sihra, Eve', 'Atkin, David']","['Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis', 'Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development', 'Cultural Economics: Religion', 'Economic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Language; Social and Economic Stratification']","['D12', 'O12', 'Z12', 'Z13']",How Do We Choose Our Identity?

Both aggregate and granular firm-level forces shape comparative advantage. The model is estimated using French microdata on firm domestic and export sales. We find that granularity accounts for about 20% of the sectoral variation in export intensity and is more pronounced in highly export-intensive sectors. An extension to a dynamic environment with both idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks reveals that firm dynamics plays a central role in shaping comparative advantage reversals observed in the data.,"['Itskhoki, Oleg', 'Gaubert, Cecile']","['Firm Behavior: Theory', 'Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Neoclassical Models of Trade', 'Empirical Studies of Trade']","['D21', 'D22', 'F11', 'F14']",Granular Comparative Advantage,0,0,0,0,0,2021,03,01

With products differentiated along a quality index and agents characterized by scalar unobserved heterogeneity, single-crossing conditions on preferences and technology provide identifying restrictions in previous work. We develop similar shape restrictions in the multiattribute case. These shape restrictions, based on optimal transport theory and generalized convexity, allow us to identify preferences for goods differentiated along multiple dimensions from the observation of a single market. We thereby derive identification results for nonseparable simultaneous equations and multi-attribute hedonic equilibrium models with (possibly) multiple dimensions of unobserved heterogeneity. One of our results is a proof of absolute continuity of the distribution of endogenously traded qualities, which is of independent interest.","['Chernozhukov, Victor', 'Pass, Brendan', 'Henry, Marc', 'Galichon, Alfred']","['Semiparametric and Nonparametric Methods: General', 'Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models; Multiple Variables: General', 'Microeconomic Behavior: Underlying Principles']","['C14', 'C30', 'D01']",Identification of Hedonic Equilibrium and Nonseparable Simultaneous Equations,0,0,0,0,0,2021,03,01

The empirical price distribution is close to the NE distribution for the stable parameter set, but for the unstable parameter set it skews toward higher prices in its NE support interval. We offer an empirical definition of price cycles in terms of changes over time in robust measures of central tendency and dispersion, by which the data exhibit persistent cycles in both treatments but larger cycles for the unstable parameters.

Sharing information reduces uncertainty about future value. With less uncertainty, risk-averse bidders bid more.

Our results can thus rationalize the paradoxical empirical observations that many real-world syndicated markets exhibit seemingly collusive pricing despite low levels of market concentration.","['Lowery, Richard', 'Hatfield, John William', 'Barry, Jordan M.', 'Kominers, Scott Duke']","['Firm Behavior: Theory', 'Market Structure, Pricing, and Design: Oligopoly and Other Forms of Market Imperfection', 'Investment Banking; Venture Capital; Brokerage; Ratings and Ratings Agencies', 'Financing Policy; Financial Risk and Risk Management; Capital and Ownership Structure; Value of Firms; Goodwill', 'Monopoly; Monopolization Strategies', 'Oligopoly and Other Imperfect Markets']","['D21', 'D43', 'G24', 'G32', 'L12', 'L13']",Collusion in Markets with Syndication,1,0,1,0,0,2020,10,01

How were the welfare losses from these declines distributed across different age groups? To address this question we construct an overlapping-generations general equilibrium model in which households face large aggregate shocks. A calibrated version of the model replicates observed dynamics for asset prices. Younger households experience larger earnings losses in a model Great Recession, but benefit from being able to buy assets at temporarily depressed prices. As a result, the model predicts that the young experience smaller welfare losses than older cohorts.","['Rios-Rull, Jose-Victor', 'Heathcote, Jonathan', 'Glover, Andrew', 'Krueger, Dirk']","['Consumer Economics: Theory', 'General Aggregative Models: Neoclassical', 'Business Fluctuations; Cycles', 'Household Saving, Borrowing, Debt, and Wealth']","['D11', 'E13', 'E32', 'G51']",Intergenerational Redistribution in the Great Recession,0,0,0,0,0,2020,10,01

We illustrate that this strong outside option improves physicians' bargaining power with insurers.

We present a method to quantify the efficiency costs of constraints on externality-correcting policies or, more generally, the costs of imperfect pricing, using simple regression statistics. Under certain conditions, the R2 and the sum of squared residuals from a regression of true externalities on policy variables measure relative welfare gains from policies. We illustrate via four empirical applications: random mismeasurement of externalities, imperfect electricity pricing, heterogeneity in the longevity of energy-consuming durable goods, and imperfect spatial policy differentiation.","['Jacobsen, Mark R.', 'Knittel, Christopher R.', 'Sallee, James M.', 'van Benthem, Arthur A.']","['Externalities', 'Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'Appliances; Furniture; Other Consumer Durables', 'Electric Utilities']","['D62', 'D72', 'L68', 'L94']",The Use of Regression Statistics to Analyze Imperfect Pricing Policies,1,0,0,0,0,2020,05,01

If not, then matching agents greedily is close to optimal.

Exploiting a law that lowered the cost of offering trade credit, we show that higher provision of trade credit to high-bargaining-power customers leads to an expansion of the suppliers' customer base.","['Serrano-Velarde, Nicolas', 'Giannetti, Mariassunta', 'Tarantino, Emanuele']","['Firm Behavior: Theory', 'Financing Policy; Financial Risk and Risk Management; Capital and Ownership Structure; Value of Firms; Goodwill', 'Antitrust Law', 'Oligopoly and Other Imperfect Markets', 'Transactional Relationships; Contracts and Reputation; Networks', 'Vertical Restraints; Resale Price Maintenance; Quantity Discounts']","['D21', 'G32', 'K21', 'L13', 'L14', 'L42']",Cheap Trade Credit and Competition in Downstream Markets,1,1,0,0,0,2021,06,01

Competition governs trade within layers, and hold-ups generate intermediation rents in transactions between layers. Each trader's intermediation power reflects the competition among intermediation chains as measured by the number of layers separating the trader from buyers. Trade does not maximize welfare or minimize intermediation. The interplay between competition and hold-ups determines the level of inefficiency. Eliminating middlemen or transferring intermediation costs downstream increases seller profits.

We find that dynamic provisioning smooths credit supply cycles and, in bad times, supports firm performance.

To empirically assess these three forces, I estimate a dynamic oligopoly model using a unique panel data set of hard disk drive manufacturers.

As a result, the optimal rate of consumption growth may be substantially lower than what is feasible, in some cases falling all the way to zero.","['Jones, Charles I.']","['Allocative Efficiency; Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Project Evaluation; Social Discount Rate', 'National Government Expenditures and Health', 'Health: General', 'Value of Life; Forgone Income', 'One, Two, and Multisector Growth Models', 'Empirical Studies of Economic Growth; Aggregate Productivity; Cross-Country Output Convergence']","['D61', 'H43', 'H51', 'I10', 'J17', 'O41', 'O47']",Life and Growth,0,0,0,0,0,2016,04,01

Competition for talent leads to an escalation of performance pay, shifting effort away from long-term investments, risk management, and cooperation. Efficiency losses can exceed those from a single principal, who dulls incentives to extract rents. As competition intensifies, monopsonistic under-incentivization of low-skill agents first decreases and then gives way to growing over-incentivization of high-skill ones. Aggregate welfare is thus hill-shaped, while inequality tends to rise monotonically. Bonus caps can help restore balance in incentives but may generate other distortions.","['Tirole, Jean', 'Benabou, Roland']","['Firm Behavior: Theory', 'Compensation Packages; Payment Methods', 'Personnel Management; Executives; Executive Compensation', 'Personnel Economics: Compensation and Compensation Methods and Their Effects']","['D21', 'J33', 'M12', 'M52']","Bonus Culture: Competitive Pay, Screening, and Multitasking",0,0,0,0,0,2016,04,01

This paper documents the prevalence of corruption and the effectiveness of vehicle emission regulations in Mexico City. I develop a statistical test for identifying a specific type of cheating that involves bribing center technicians. I also estimate a structural model of car owner retesting and cheating decisions. Results suggest that 9.6 percent of car owners paid US$20 to circumvent the regulation. Eliminating cheating and increasing the cost of retests would reduce emissions by 3,708 tons at a high cost for vehicle owners.","['Oliva, Paulina']","['Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'Energy, Environmental, Health, and Safety Law', 'Economic Development: Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Other Primary Products', 'Formal and Informal Sectors; Shadow Economy; Institutional Arrangements', 'Air Pollution; Water Pollution; Noise; Hazardous Waste; Solid Waste; Recycling', 'Environmental Economics: Government Policy']","['D72', 'K32', 'O13', 'O17', 'Q53', 'Q58']",Environmental Regulations and Corruption: Automobile Emissions in Mexico City,0,1,0,0,0,2015,06,01

Proponents of these policies contend that employment impacts are negligible and suggest that consumers pay for higher labor costs through imperceptible increases in goods prices. Adopting this empirical scenario, the analysis demonstrates that an increase in the national minimum wage produces a value-added tax effect on consumer prices that is more regressive than a typical state sales tax and allocates benefits as higher earnings nearly evenly across the income distribution. These income-transfer outcomes sharply contradict portraying an increase in the minimum wage as an antipoverty initiative.","['MaCurdy, Thomas']","['Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities; Redistributive Effects; Environmental Taxes and Subsidies', 'Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Wages, Compensation, and Labor Costs: Public Policy']","['H23', 'I38', 'J31', 'J38']",How Effective Is the Minimum Wage at Supporting the Poor?,0,0,0,0,0,2015,04,01

Financial agents or bankers must earn moral-hazard rents, but the cost of these rents can be efficiently spread over an agent's entire career by promising large late-career rewards if the agent has a consistently successful record. Dynamic interactions among different generations of financial agents can create credit cycles with repeated booms and recessions. In recessions, a scarcity of trusted financial intermediaries limits investment and reduces employment. Under such conditions, taxing workers to subsidize bankers may increase employment enough to make the workers better off.","['Myerson, Roger B.']","['Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design', 'Investment; Capital; Intangible Capital; Capacity', 'Employment; Unemployment; Wages; Intergenerational Income Distribution; Aggregate Human Capital; Aggregate Labor Productivity', 'Business Fluctuations; Cycles', 'Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy', 'Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages']","['D82', 'E22', 'E24', 'E32', 'E44', 'G21']",A Model of Moral-Hazard Credit Cycles,0,0,0,0,0,2012,10,01

Schools seeking autonomy had only to propose and win a majority vote among current parents. Almost one in three high schools voted on autonomy between 1988 and 1997, and using a version of the regression discontinuity design, I find large achievement gains at schools in which the vote barely won compared to schools in which it barely lost. Despite other reforms that ensured that the British education system was, by international standards, highly competitive, a comparison of schools in the geographic neighborhoods of narrow vote winners and narrow vote losers suggests that these gains did not spill over.","['Clark, Damon']","['State and Local Government: Health; Education; Welfare; Public Pensions', 'Analysis of Education', 'Education: Government Policy']","['H75', 'I21', 'I28']",The Performance and Competitive Effects of School Autonomy,0,0,0,0,0,2009,08,01

In particular, in less financially developed economies (South), trade and capital mobility are complements in the sense that trade integration increases the return to capital and thus the incentives for capital to flow to South. This interaction implies that deepening trade integration in South raises net capital inflows (or reduces net capital outflows).

Diesel fuel used for on-road purposes is taxed, while other uses are untaxed, creating an incentive for firms and individuals to evade on-road diesel taxes by purchasing untaxed diesel fuel and then using it for on-road use. We examine the effects of a federal regulatory innovation in October 1993, the addition of red dye to untaxed diesel fuel at the point of distribution, which significantly lowered the cost of regulatory enforcement. We find that sales of diesel fuel rose 26 percent following the regulatory change, while sales of heating oil, which is an untaxed perfect substitute, fell by a similar amount. The effect on sales was higher in states with higher tax rates and in states likely to have higher audit costs. We also find evidence that heating oil sales were less responsive to demand factors, such as temperature, prior to the dye program, indicating that a significant fraction of predye sales was illegitimate. Furthermore, we find a pattern of price and tax elasticities consistent with innovation in new evasion techniques subsequent to the regulatory change. Finally, we estimate that the elasticity of tax revenues with respect to the tax rate was 0.60 prior to the dye program yet would have been 0.85 in the absence of evasion.","['Marion, Justin', 'Muehlegger, Erich']","['Tax Evasion and Avoidance', 'State and Local Government: Health; Education; Welfare; Public Pensions', 'Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law', 'Economics of Regulation', 'Mining, Extraction, and Refining: Hydrocarbon Fuels']","['H26', 'H75', 'K42', 'L51', 'L71']",Measuring Illegal Activity and the Effects of Regulatory Innovation: Tax Evasion and the Dyeing of Untaxed Diesel,1,1,0,0,0,2008,08,01

First, I find that increases in benefits have much larger effects on durations for liquidity-constrained households. Second, lump-sum severance payments increase durations substantially among constrained households. I derive a formula for the optimal benefit level that depends only on the reduced-form liquidity and moral hazard elasticities. The formula implies that the optimal UI benefit level exceeds 50 percent of the wage.

It embeds a boundary discontinuity design in a heterogeneous residential choice model, addressing the endogeneity of school and neighborhood characteristics. The model is estimated using restricted-access Census data from a large metropolitan area, yielding a number of new results. First, households are willing to pay less than 1 percent more in house prices--substantially lower than previous estimates--when the average performance of the local school increases by 5 percent. Second, much of the apparent willingness to pay for more educated and wealthier neighbors is explained by the correlation of these sociodemographic measures with unobserved neighborhood quality. Third, neighborhood race is not capitalized directly into housing prices; instead, the negative correlation of neighborhood percent black and housing prices is due entirely to the fact that blacks live in unobservably lower-quality neighborhoods. Finally, there is considerable heterogeneity in preferences for schools and neighbors, with households preferring to self-segregate on the basis of both race and education.","['Bayer, Patrick', 'Ferreira, Fernando', 'McMillan, Robert']","['Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis', 'Analysis of Education', 'Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics', 'Housing Supply and Markets']","['D12', 'I21', 'R23', 'R31']",A Unified Framework for Measuring Preferences for Schools and Neighborhoods,0,0,0,0,0,2007,08,01

I use store-level price data on 915 consumer price index products to show that the increase in aggregate demand prompted by the arrival of the FSU immigration significantly reduced prices during 1990. When one controls for native population size and city and month effects, a one-percentage-point increase in the ratio of immigrants to natives in a city decreases prices by 0.5 percentage point on average. It is argued that this negative immigration effect is consistent with FSU immigrants--the new consumers--having higher price elasticities and lower search costs than the native population. Thus immigration can have a moderating effect on inflation through its direct effect on product markets, and not only by increasing the supply of labor.","['Lach, Saul']","['Price Level; Inflation; Deflation', 'Demographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts', 'Geographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers']","['E31', 'J11', 'J61']",Immigration and Prices,0,0,0,0,0,2007,08,01

After a sequence of bad shocks, the borrower in a competitive market accumulates debt so large that the incumbent lenders exercise monopoly power. Even though the incumbents could maintain this power forever, they find it profitable to let the borrower regain access to the competitive market after a sequence of good shocks. Equilibria are computed numerically, and their attributes are qualitatively consistent with numerous known empirical facts on sovereign lending. In addition, the model predicts that a borrower who accumulates debt overhang will regain access to the competitive credit market only after good shocks.

There is little evidence that foreclosure is quantitatively important in these industries. Instead, prices fall, quantities rise, and entry rates remain unchanged when markets become more integrated. These patterns are consistent, however, with an alternative efficiency-based mechanism. Namely, higher-productivity producers are more likely to vertically integrate and are also larger, more likely to survive, and more likely to charge lower prices. We find evidence that integrated producers' productivity advantage is tied to improved logistics coordination afforded by large local concrete operations. Interestingly, this benefit is not due to firms' vertical structures per se: nonvertical firms with large local concrete operations have similarly high productivity levels.","['Hortacsu, Ali', 'Syverson, Chad']","['Production, Pricing, and Market Structure; Size Distribution of Firms', 'Firm Organization and Market Structure', 'Metals and Metal Products; Cement; Glass; Ceramics']","['L11', 'L22', 'L61']","Cementing Relationships: Vertical Integration, Foreclosure, Productivity, and Prices",1,0,0,0,0,2007,04,01

Children born after the abortion ban attained more years of schooling and greater labor market success. The reason is that urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, and the relative number of children born to this type of woman increased after the ban.

So optimal public expenditures on apprehension and conviction of illegal suppliers depend not only on the difference between the social and private values from consumption but also on these elasticities. When demand and supply are not too elastic, it does not pay to enforce any prohibition unless the social value is negative.

While agents drawn from a well-functioning marketplace behave in accord with social preference models in tightly controlled laboratory experiments, when they are observed in their naturally occurring settings, their behavior approaches what is predicted by self-interest theory. In the limit, much of the observed behavior in the marketplace that is consistent with social preferences is due to reputational concerns: suppliers who expect to have future interactions with buyers provide higher product quality only when the buyer can verify quality via a third-party certifier. The data also speak to theories of how reputation effects enhance market performance.

An exogenous institutional rule prescribes which moves from one state to another are feasible to each coalition. At each time, an agent is called to act with some exogenous probability, and he chooses a coalition, a feasible new state to move the economy to, and side payments between the agents in the coalition. The setup can be applied to various dynamic processes of social and economic interactions such as legislative bargaining, coalition formation, or exchange economies. Whenever agents are unable to write long-term contracts, but are otherwise unconstrained both in their ability to write arbitrary spot contracts and in their ability to collude, there can be long-run inefficiencies (with cycles or inefficient steady states). However, when agents are sufficiently patient, the initial state from which the process starts plays no role in the long run. Moreover, when there exists an efficient state that is free of negative externalities (in the sense that a move away from that state does not hurt the agents whose consent is not required for the move), the system must converge to this efficient state in the long run.

TSPs nonattainment status is associated with large reductions in TSPs pollution and increases in county-level housing prices. When nonattainment status is used as an instrumental variable for TSPs, we find that the elasticity of housing values with respect to particulates concentrations ranges from -0.20 to -0.35. These estimates of the average marginal willingness to pay for clean air are robust to quasi-experimental regression discontinuity and matching specification tests. Further, they are far less sensitive to model specification than cross-sectional and fixed-effects estimates, which occasionally have the ""perverse"" sign. We also find modest evidence that the marginal benefit of reductions of TSPs is lower in communities with relatively high pollution levels, which is consistent with preference-based sorting.

One important proposal under discussion is whether to privatize water provision. In the 1990s Argentina embarked on one of the largest privatization campaigns in the world, including the privatization of local water companies covering approximately 30 percent of the country's municipalities. Using the variation in ownership of water provision across time and space generated by the privatization process, we find that child mortality fell 8 percent in the areas that privatized their water services and that the effect was largest (26 percent) in the poorest areas. We check the robustness of these estimates using cause-specific mortality. While privatization is associated with significant reductions in deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases, it is uncorrelated with deaths from causes unrelated to water conditions.","['Schargrodsky, Ernesto', 'Galiani, Sebastian', 'Gertler, Paul']","['Health Behavior', 'Health: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health', 'Fertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth', 'Comparison of Public and Private Enterprises and Nonprofit Institutions; Privatization; Contracting Out', 'Gas Utilities; Pipelines; Water Utilities', 'Economic Development: Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Other Primary Products', 'Economic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration']","['I12', 'I18', 'J13', 'L33', 'L95', 'O13', 'O15']",Water for Life: The Impact of the Privatization of Water Services on Child Mortality,1,0,0,0,0,2005,02,01

We quantify the effects of tax rates on tax evasion by examining the relationship in China between the tariff schedule and the ""evasion gap,"" which we define as the difference between Hong Kong's reported exports to China at the product level and China's reported imports from Hong Kong. Our results imply that a one-percentage-point increase in the tax rate is associated with a 3 percent increase in evasion. Furthermore, the evasion gap is negatively correlated with tax rates on closely related products, suggesting that evasion takes place partly through misclassification of imports from higher-taxed categories to lower-taxed ones, in addition to underreporting the value of imports.","['Wei, Shang-Jin', 'Fisman, Raymond']","['Personal Income and Other Nonbusiness Taxes and Subsidies; includes inheritance and gift taxes', 'Tax Evasion and Avoidance', 'Socialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Public Economics']","['H24', 'H26', 'P35']",Tax Rates and Tax Evasion: Evidence from 'Missing Imports' in China,0,0,0,0,0,2004,04,01

Empirical identification of borrowing constraints is secured by the economic prediction that opportunity costs and direct costs of schooling affect borrowing-constrained and unconstrained persons differently. Direct costs need to be financed during school and impose a larger burden on credit-constrained students. By contrast, gross foregone earnings do not have to be financed. We explore the implications of this idea using four methodologies: schooling attainment models, instrumental variable wage regressions, and two structural economic models that integrate both schooling choices and schooling returns into a unified framework. None of the methods produces evidence that borrowing constraints generate inefficiencies in the market for schooling in the current policy environment. We conclude that, on the margin, additional policies aimed at improving credit access will have little impact on schooling attainment.","['Taber, Christopher', 'Cameron, Stephen V.']","['Analysis of Education', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity']","['I21', 'J24']",Estimation of Educational Borrowing Constraints Using Returns to Schooling,0,0,0,0,0,2004,02,01

As productivity improves in these industries, each consumer good becomes affordable to an increasingly large number of households, which constantly expand the range of goods they consume. This in turn generates larger markets for consumer goods, which leads to further improvement in productivity. For such virtuous cycles of productivity gains and expanding markets to occur, income distribution should be neither too equal nor too unequal. With too much equality, the economy stagnates in a poverty trap.

In voting in favor of employment protection, incumbent employees trade off lower living standards (because employment protection maintains workers in less productive activities) against longer job duration. The latter is valued because the employed have rents, achieving wages above their alternative value. The gains from, and consequently the political support for, employment protection are larger the lower the rate of creative destruction (i.e., the lower the growth rate) and the larger the employee's bargaining power. Hence, employment protection is more likely to arise in economies with greater worker bargaining power. Also, workers in older vintages are more in favor of employment protection. Consequently, greater initial protection increases its own support by maintaining a larger fraction of the workforce in older vintages. Finally, if workers can invest ex ante in match-specific human capital, multiple steady-state political equilibria may arise, as the outcome of the mutual feedback between employee rents and employment protection.","['Saint-Paul, Gilles']","['Mobility, Unemployment, and Vacancies: Public Policy', 'Personnel Economics: Firm Employment Decisions; Promotions', 'Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes', 'Labor Demand']","['J68', 'M51', 'O33', 'J23']",The Political Economy of Employment Protection,0,0,0,1,0,2002,06,01

110,3,2002-06-01,"The lumpiness of investment activity at the plant level is a well-established fact. Previous research has suggested that such discrete and occasional adjustments have significant aggregate implications. In particular, it has been argued that changes in plants' willingness to invest in response to aggregate shocks can at times generate large movements in total investment demand. In this study, I reassess these predictions in a general equilibrium environment. Specifically, assuming nonconvex costs of capital adjustment, I derive generalized (S, s) adjustment rules yielding lumpy plant-level investment within an otherwise standard equilibrium business cycle model. In contrast to previous partial equilibrium analyses, model results reveal that the aggregate effects of lumpy investment are negligible. In general equilibrium, households' preference for relatively smooth consumption profiles offsets changes in aggregate investment demand implied by the introduction of lumpy plant-level investment. As a result, adjustments in wages and interest rates yield quantity dynamics that are virtually indistinguishable from the standard model, and lumpy investment appears largely irrelevant for equilibrium business cycle analysis.","['Thomas, Julia K.']","['Business Fluctuations; Cycles', 'Investment; Capital; Intangible Capital; Capacity', 'Capital Budgeting; Fixed Investment and Inventory Studies; Capacity']","['E32', 'E22', 'G31']",Is Lumpy Investment Relevant for the Business Cycle?,0,0,0,0,0,2002,06,01

This paper provides empirical evidence on how Internet comparison shopping sites affected the prices of life insurance in the 1990s. With micro data on individual insurance policies and with individual and policy characteristics controlled for, hedonic-type regressions show that increases in Internet use significantly reduced the price of term life insurance. Further evidence shows that prices did not fall with rising Internet usage in the period before the sites began, nor for insurance types that were not covered on the sites. The results suggest that the growth of the Internet has reduced term life prices by 8-15 percent. The results also show that the initial introduction of the Internet search sites is initially associated with an increase in price dispersion within demographic groups, but as use spreads, the dispersion falls.","['Goolsbee, Austan', 'Brown, Jeffrey R.']","['Insurance; Insurance Companies; Actuarial Studies', 'Information and Internet Services; Computer Software', 'Production, Pricing, and Market Structure; Size Distribution of Firms', 'Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes']","['G22', 'L86', 'L11', 'O33']",Does the Internet Make Markets More Competitive?

This results because some potential high school dropouts and university enrollees choose the high school graduate designation in order to take advantage of high-ability individuals who are constrained from entering university. This is in stark contrast to human capital theory, which predicts higher university enrollment but identical high school dropout rates in regions with greater university access. I test the contradictory high school dropout predictions of the human capital and signaling models using NLSYM and NLSYW education data from the late 1960s and early 1970s.

(2) Microeconometrics improved on aggregate time-series methods by building models that linked economic models for individuals to data on individual behavior. (3) An important empirical regularity detected by the field is the diversity and heterogeneity of behavior. This heterogeneity has profound consequences for economic theory and for econometric practice.

Unfortunately, this parameter has been difficult to estimate in the context of the U.S. disability insurance program since all workers face an identical benefits schedule. I surmount this problem by studying the experience of Canada, which operates two distinct disability insurance programs: for Quebec and for the rest of Canada. The latter program raised its benefits by 36 percent in January 1987, whereas benefits in Quebec were constant.

This financial flexibility is costly since banks face costs of capital themselves (which they attempt to minimize through securitization). To avoid this intermediation cost, firms may turn to bond or equity financing, but bonds imply an inefficient liquidation cost and equity an informational dilution cost.

We model the behavior that an expected compensation-maximizing agent would exhibit when faced with such contracts and derive several testable implications. Our empirical results are consistent with the theoretical predictions, and so we are able to use this relatively clean setting to contribute to the growing literature concerned with determining the impact of incentive contracts on behavior.

Agents trade financial securities to buffer idiosyncratic shocks but the extent of trade is limited by borrowing constraints and transactions costs. The effect of frictions on the equity premium is decomposed into two components: a direct effect due to the equation of net-of-costs margins and an indirect effect due to increased consumption volatility. Simulations suggest that the direct effect dominates and that the model predicts a sizable equity premium only if costs are large or the quantity of tradable assets is limited.,"['Lucas, Deborah J.', 'Heaton, John']","['Asset Pricing; Trading Volume; Bond Interest Rates', 'Incomplete Markets']","[nan, 'D52']",Evaluating the Effects of Incomplete Markets on Risk Sharing and Asset Pricing,0,0,0,0,0,1996,06,01

As the firms' technologies gradually improve, industry output expands and price falls. Technological leaders tend to rely on innovations to reduce their costs, whereas the laggards rely more on imitation. Imitation causes technology to spread from the leaders to the followers and forces some convergence of technology among firms as the industry matures. This convergence is accompanied by faster growth of smaller firms and a consequent tightening of the distribution of output over firms.","['MacDonald, Glenn M.', 'Jovanovic, Boyan']","['Production, Pricing, and Market Structure; Size Distribution of Firms', 'Innovation and Invention: Processes and Incentives']","['L11', 'O31']",Competitive Diffusion,1,0,0,1,0,1994,02,01

Since prices are primarily determined by costs, demand shocks have small effects on real wages. Thus, insiders have little incentive to change to more complicated contracts. With rigid nominal wages, nominal demand shocks have large effects on the employment opportunities of outsiders.","['Gottfries, Nils']","['Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Employment; Unemployment; Wages; Intergenerational Income Distribution; Aggregate Human Capital; Aggregate Labor Productivity', 'Labor Contracts']","['J31', 'E24', 'J41']","Insiders, Outsiders, and Nominal Wage Contracts",0,0,0,0,0,1992,04,01

Prescott, states that, for plausible values of the risk aversion coefficient, the difference of the expected rate of return on the stock market and the riskless rate of interest is too large, given the observed small variance of the growth rate in per capita consumption. The puzzle is resolved in the context of an economy with rational expectations once the time separability of von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences is relaxed to allow for adjacent complementarity in consumption, a property known as habit persistence. Essentially, habit persistence drives a wedge between the relative risk aversion of the representative agent and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption.","['Constantinides, George M.']","['Capital Markets: Theory, Including Portfolio Selection, and Empirical Studies Illustrating Theory', 'Macroeconomic Theory General']","[nan, nan]",Habit Formation: A Resolution of the Equity Premium Puzzle,0,0,0,0,0,1990,06,01

However, when agents distinguish permanent and transitory movements in their labor income, the permanent income hypothesis correctly predicts the observed smoothness in consumption.","['Quah, Danny']",['Macroeconomics Theory of Aggregate Demand: Consumption'],[nan],Permanent and Transitory Movements in Labor Income: An Explanation for 'Excess Smoothness' in Consumption,0,0,0,0,0,1990,06,01

Such an equilibrium has the advantage of avoiding the incentive constraints that arise in ""separating"" equilibria, where information can be inferred from prices. Thus, the efficient market hypothesis may well fail if there is imperfect competition.

Since buyers face the constant threat of incoming younger (hence richer) customers, their bargaining position is weakened by inflation, allowing sellers to extract a higher real price. However, they show that higher inflation also reduces buyers' search, increasing sellers' wait for customers. As a result, the volume of transactions concluded in the decentralized sector falls.

We focus on the determinants (demand elasticities, persistence of technology change, etc.) of the severity of the has-beens effect.

The joint venture we examine is the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 1980s, which was then composed of 21 separately owned teams. (It now has 30 teams.) The restriction we analyze is the NHL rule on franchise relocation. Before one can fully understand the effect of the restriction, one must understand the theory of how sports leagues operate and whether sports leagues have any market power that can be enhanced by such a restriction. After providing such a theory, we empirically test the effect of the NHL restriction on franchise relocation. Aside from data availability, the advantage of our time period is that television was then an unimportant source of revenue for the NHL. Thus we are able to isolate a particular externality arising from how the NHL finances teams.","['Landes, Elisabeth M.', 'Frankel, Alan S.', 'Carlton, Dennis W.']","['Transactional Relationships; Contracts and Reputation; Networks', 'Contracting Out; Joint Ventures; Technology Licensing', 'Sports; Gambling; Restaurants; Recreation; Tourism']","['L14', 'L24', 'L83']",The Control of Externalities in Sports Leagues: An Analysis of Restrictions in the National Hockey League,1,0,0,0,0,2004,02,02

Since the states that adopted the higher speed limit must have valued the travel hours they saved more than the fatalities incurred, this institutional change provides an opportunity to estimate an upper bound on the public's willingness to trade off wealth for a change in the probability of death. Our estimates indicate that the adoption of the 65-mph limit increased speeds by approximately 4 percent, or 2.5 mph, and fatality rates by roughly 35 percent. Together, the estimates suggest that about 125,000 hours were saved per lost life. When the time saved is valued at the average hourly wage, the estimates imply that adopting states were willing to accept risks that resulted in a savings of $1.54 million (1997 dollars) per fatality, with a sampling error roughly one-third this value. We set out a simple model of states' decisions to adopt the 65-mph limit that turns on whether their savings exceed their value of a statistical life. The empirical implementation of this model supports the claim that $1.54 million is the upper bound, but it provides imprecise estimates of the value of a statistical life.","['Greenstone, Michael', 'Ashenfelter, Orley']","['Value of Life; Forgone Income', 'Energy, Environmental, Health, and Safety Law', 'Transportation: Demand, Supply, and Congestion; Travel Time; Safety and Accidents; Transportation Noise', 'Transportation Economics: Government Pricing and Policy']","['J17', 'K32', 'R41', 'R48']",Using Mandated Speed Limits to Measure the Value of a Statistical Life,0,1,0,0,0,2004,02,02

The employees who fail to join the plan or who participate at a very low level appear to be saving at less than the predicted life cycle savings rates. Behavioral explanations for this behavior stress bounded rationality and self-control and suggest that at least some of the low-saving households are making a mistake and would welcome aid in making decisions about their saving. In this paper, we propose such a prescriptive savings program, called Save More Tomorrow (hereafter, the SMarT program). The essence of the program is straightforward: people commit in advance to allocating a portion of their future salary increases toward retirement savings. We report evidence on the first three implementations of the SMarT program. Our key findings, from the first implementation, which has been in place for four annual raises, are as follows: (1) a high proportion (78 percent) of those offered the plan joined, (2) the vast majority of those enrolled in the SMarT plan (80 percent) remained in it through the fourth pay raise, and (3) the average saving rates for SMarT program participants increased from 3.5 percent to 13.6 percent over the course of 40 months.

112,1,2004-02-02,"Some have observed that individuals perform worse after being promoted. The Peter principle, which states that people are promoted to their level of incompetence, suggests that something is fundamentally misaligned in the promotion process. This view is till unnecessary and inconsistent with the data. Below, it is argued that ability appears lower after promotion purely as a statistical matter. Being promoted is evidence that a standard has been met. Regression to the mean implies that future ability will be lower, on average. Firms optimally account for the regression bias in making promotion decisions, but the effect is never eliminated. Rather than evidence of a mistake, the Peter principle is a necessary consequence of any promotion rule. Furthermore, firms that take it into account appropriately adopt an optimal strategy. Usually, firms inflate the promotion criterion to offset the Peter principle effect, and the more important the transitory component is relative to total variation in ability, the larger the amount that the standard is inflated. The same logic applies to other situations. For example, it explains why movie sequels are worse than the original film on which they are based and why second visits to restaurants arc less rewarding than the first.","['Lazear, Edward P.']","['Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Job, Occupational, and Intergenerational Mobility; Promotion']","['J24', 'J62']",The Peter Principle: A Theory of Decline,0,0,0,0,0,2004,02,02

98,5,1990-10-02,"The authors' analysis of growth assumes endogenous fertility and a rising rate of return on human capital as the stock of human capital increases. When human capital is abundant, rates of return on human capital investments are high relative to rates of return on children, whereas, when human capital is scarce, rates of return on human capital are low relative to those on children. As a result, societies with limited human capital choose large families and invest little in each member; those with abundant human capital do the opposite. This leads to two stable steady states. One has large families and little human capital; the other has small families and perhaps growing human and physical capital.","['Becker, Gary S.', 'Tamura, Robert', 'Murphy, Kevin M.']","['Economic Development Models and Theories', 'Demographic Economics', 'Human Capital; Value of Human Life']","[nan, nan, nan]","Human Capital, Fertility, and Economic Growth",0,0,0,0,0,1990,10,02
