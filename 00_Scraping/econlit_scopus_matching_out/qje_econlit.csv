136,1,2021-02-01,"We study how long-lived rational agents learn from repeatedly observing a private signal and each others' actions. With normal signals, a group of any size learns more slowly than just four agents who directly observe each others' private signals in each period. Similar results apply to general signal structures. We identify rational groupthink--in which agents ignore their private signals and choose the same action for long periods of time--as the cause of this failure of information aggregation.","['Mossel, Elchanan', 'Harel, Matan', 'Strack, Philipp', 'Tamuz, Omer']","['Consumer Economics: Theory', 'Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design', 'Micro-Based Behavioral Economics: Role and Effects of Psychological, Emotional, Social, and Cognitive Factors on Decision Making']","['D11', 'D82', 'D91']",Rational Groupthink,0,0,0,0,0,2021,02,01
136,1,2021-02-01,"I study how a credit crunch affects output price dynamics. I build a unique micro-level data set that combines scanner-level prices and quantities with producer information, including the producer's banking relationships, inventory, and cash holdings. I exploit the Lehman Brothers failure as a quasi-experiment and find that the firms facing a negative credit supply shock decrease their output prices approximately 15% more than their unaffected counterparts. I hypothesize that such firms reduce prices to liquidate inventory and generate additional cash flow from the product market. I find strong empirical support for this hypothesis: (i) the firms that face a negative bank shock temporarily decrease their prices and inventory and increase their market share and cash holdings relative to their counterparts, and (ii) this effect is stronger for the firms and sectors with a high initial inventory or small initial cash holdings.","['Kim, Ryan']","['Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Intertemporal Firm Choice: Investment, Capacity, and Financing', 'Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages', 'Capital Budgeting; Fixed Investment and Inventory Studies; Capacity', 'Financing Policy; Financial Risk and Risk Management; Capital and Ownership Structure; Value of Firms; Goodwill']","['D22', 'D25', 'G21', 'G31', 'G32']",The Effect of the Credit Crunch on Output Price Dynamics: The Corporate Inventory and Liquidity Management Channel,0,0,0,0,0,2021,02,01
136,1,2021-02-01,"This article argues that accounting for capital-embodied technology greatly increases the importance of capital in explaining cross-country differences in agricultural labor productivity. To do so, we draw on a novel data set of agricultural capital prices. We document that new capital is more expensive in richer countries, both in absolute terms and relative to old capital. A model of endogenous adoption of capital of different quality links these price differences to the path of capital-embodied technology. In particular, our model recovers the level of embodied technology from the price of new capital and the growth rate of embodied technology from the price of new capital relative to old capital. We then measure the stocks of quality-adjusted capital in agriculture for a sample of 16 countries at different stages of development. We find that adjusting for differences in quality almost doubles the importance of capital in accounting for cross-country differences in agricultural labor productivity: from 21% to 37%. In addition, improvements in capital quality have been an important source of agricultural labor productivity growth over the past 25 years, accounting for 21% and 35% of the productivity growth in poor and rich countries, respectively.","['Keller, Elisa', 'Caunedo, Julieta']","['Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Agricultural Labor Markets', 'Economic Development: Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Other Primary Products', 'Management of Technological Innovation and R&D', 'Micro Analysis of Farm Firms, Farm Households, and Farm Input Markets', 'Agricultural R&D; Agricultural Technology; Biofuels; Agricultural Extension Services']","['J24', 'J43', 'O13', 'O32', 'Q12', 'Q16']",Capital Obsolescence and Agricultural Productivity,0,0,0,1,0,2021,02,01

We explore how players might misuse communication to threaten one another, and we identify ways that organizations can deter misuse and restore cooperation. In our model, a principal plays trust games with a sequence of short-run agents who communicate with each other. An agent can shirk and then extort pay by threatening to report that the principal deviated. We show that these threats can completely undermine cooperation. Investigations of agents' efforts, or dyadic relationships between the principal and each agent, can deter extortion and restore some cooperation. Investigations of the principal's action, on the other hand, typically do not help. Our analysis suggests that collective punishments are vulnerable to misuse unless they are designed with an eye toward discouraging it.","['Guo, Yingni', 'Barron, Daniel']","['Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design', 'Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law']","['D82', 'K42']",The Use and Misuse of Coordinated Punishments,0,1,0,0,0,2021,02,01

We collect data from female sex workers and their clients before and after the change. We find that criminalization increases sexually transmitted infections among female sex workers by 58 percent, measured by biological tests. This is driven by decreased condom access and use. We also find evidence that criminalization decreases earnings among women who left sex work due to criminalization and decreases their ability to meet their children's school expenses while increasing the likelihood that children begin working to supplement household income. Although criminalization has the potential to improve population STI outcomes if the market shrinks permanently, we show that five years postcriminalization the market has rebounded and the probability of STI transmission in the general population is likely to have increased.","['Cameron, Lisa', 'Seager, Jennifer', 'Shah, Manisha']","['Health Behavior', 'Economics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Informal Labor Markets', 'Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law', 'Economic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration', 'Formal and Informal Sectors; Shadow Economy; Institutional Arrangements']","['I12', 'J16', 'J46', 'K42', 'O15', 'O17']",Crimes against Morality: Unintended Consequences of Criminalizing Sex Work,0,1,0,0,0,2021,02,01
136,1,2021-02-01,"We relate gender differences in willingness to commute to the gender wage gap. Using French administrative data on job search criteria, we first document that unemployed women have a lower reservation wage and a shorter maximum acceptable commute than their male counterparts. We identify indifference curves between wage and commute using the joint distributions of reservation job attributes and accepted job bundles. Indifference curves are steeper for women, who value commute around 20% more than men. Controlling in particular for the previous job, newly hired women are paid after unemployment 4% less per hour and have a 12% shorter commute than men. Through the lens of a job search model where commuting matters, we estimate that gender differences in commute valuation can account for a 0.5 log point hourly wage deficit for women, that is, 14% of the residualized gender wage gap. Finally, we use job application data to test the robustness of our results and to show that female workers do not receive less demand from far-away employers, confirming that most of the gender gap in commute is supply-side driven.","['Roulet, Alexandra', 'Le Barbanchon, Thomas', 'Rathelot, Roland']","['Economics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Time Allocation and Labor Supply', 'Labor Demand', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Unemployment: Models, Duration, Incidence, and Job Search']","['J16', 'J22', 'J23', 'J31', 'J64']",Gender Differences in Job Search: Trading Off Commute against Wage,0,0,0,0,0,2021,02,01

Six months after the program ended, treated households have higher religiosity and income; no statistically significant differences in total labor supply, consumption, food security, or life satisfaction; and lower perceived relative economic status. Exploratory analysis suggests that the income treatment effect may operate through increasing grit. Thirty months after the program ended, significant differences in the intensity of religiosity disappear, but those in the treatment group are less likely to be Catholic and more likely to be Protestant, and there is some mixed evidence that their consumption and perceived relative economic status are higher.","['Bryan, Gharad', 'Choi, James J.', 'Karlan, Dean']","['Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis', 'Household Saving, Borrowing, Debt, and Wealth', 'General Welfare; Well-Being', 'Measurement and Analysis of Poverty', 'Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development', 'Cultural Economics: Religion']","['D12', 'G51', 'I31', 'I32', 'O12', 'Z12']",Randomizing Religion: The Impact of Protestant Evangelism on Economic Outcomes,0,0,0,0,0,2021,02,01
136,1,2021-02-01,"Macro-finance analyses commonly link firms' borrowing constraints to the liquidation value of physical assets. For U.S. nonfinancial firms, we show that 20% of debt by value is based on such assets (asset-based lending in creditor parlance), whereas 80% is based predominantly on cash flows from firms' operations (cash flow-based lending). A standard borrowing constraint restricts total debt as a function of cash flows measured using operating earnings (earnings-based borrowing constraints). These features shape firm outcomes on the margin: first, cash flows in the form of operating earnings can directly relax borrowing constraints; second, firms are less vulnerable to collateral damage from asset price declines, and fire sale amplification may be mitigated. Taken together, our findings point to new venues for modeling firms' borrowing constraints in macro-finance studies.","['Lian, Chen', 'Ma, Yueran']","['Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Equities; Fixed Income Securities', 'Financing Policy; Financial Risk and Risk Management; Capital and Ownership Structure; Value of Firms; Goodwill', 'Firm Performance: Size, Diversification, and Scope']","['D22', 'G12', 'G32', 'L25']",Anatomy of Corporate Borrowing Constraints,1,0,0,0,0,2021,02,01
136,1,2021-02-01,"The earnings difference between white and black workers fell dramatically in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This article shows that the expansion of the minimum wage played a critical role in this decline. The 1966 Fair Labor Standards Act extended federal minimum wage coverage to agriculture, restaurants, nursing homes, and other services that were previously uncovered and where nearly a third of black workers were employed. We digitize over 1,000 hourly wage distributions from Bureau of Labor Statistics industry wage reports and use CPS microdata to investigate the effects of this reform on wages, employment, and racial inequality. Using a cross-industry difference-in-differences design, we show that earnings rose sharply for workers in the newly covered industries. The impact was nearly twice as large for black workers as for white workers. Within treated industries, the racial gap adjusted for observables fell from 25 log points prereform to 0 afterward. We can rule out significant disemployment effects for black workers. Using a bunching design, we find no aggregate effect of the reform on employment. The 1967 extension of the minimum wage can explain more than 20% of the reduction in the racial earnings and income gap during the civil rights era. Our findings shed new light on the dynamics of labor market inequality in the United States and suggest that minimum wage policy can play a critical role in reducing racial economic disparities.","['Derenoncourt, Ellora', 'Montialoux, Claire']","['Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Wages, Compensation, and Labor Costs: Public Policy', 'Labor Discrimination', 'Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics']","['J15', 'J31', 'J38', 'J71', 'R23']",Minimum Wages and Racial Inequality,0,0,0,0,0,2021,02,01

To do this, we construct a new data set on bank equity returns and narrative information on banking panics for 46 countries over the period of 1870 to 2016. We find that even in the absence of panics, large bank equity declines are associated with substantial credit contractions and output gaps. Although panics are an important amplification mechanism, our results indicate that panics are not necessary for banking crises to have severe economic consequences. Furthermore, panics tend to be preceded by large bank equity declines, suggesting that panics are the result, rather than the cause, of earlier bank losses. We use bank equity returns to uncover a number of forgotten historical banking crises and create a banking crisis chronology that distinguishes between bank equity losses and panics.","['Verner, Emil', 'Baron, Matthew', 'Xiong, Wei']","['Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy', 'Financial Crises', 'Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages', 'Financial Institutions and Services: Government Policy and Regulation', 'Economic History: Financial Markets and Institutions: General, International, or Comparative']","['E44', 'G01', 'G21', 'G28', 'N20']",Banking Crises without Panics,0,0,0,0,0,2021,02,01

Although this is well understood theoretically, it is unclear how large the welfare distortions are in the aggregate economy. Do they matter quantitatively? To answer this question, we develop a multisector monopolistic competition model with endogenous firm entry and selection, productivity, and markups. Using French and UK data, we quantify the gap between the equilibrium and optimal allocations. We find that inefficiencies in the labor allocation and entry between sectors, as well as inefficient selection and output per firm within sectors, generate welfare losses of about 6%-10% of GDP.","['Suedekum, Jens', 'Behrens, Kristian', 'Mion, Giordano', 'Murata, Yasusada']","['Production; Cost; Capital; Capital, Total Factor, and Multifactor Productivity; Capacity', 'Macroeconomics: Production', 'Employment; Unemployment; Wages; Intergenerational Income Distribution; Aggregate Human Capital; Aggregate Labor Productivity', 'Labor Force and Employment, Size, and Structure', 'Oligopoly and Other Imperfect Markets']","['D24', 'E23', 'E24', 'J21', 'L13']",Quantifying the Gap between Equilibrium and Optimum under Monopolistic Competition,1,0,0,0,0,2020,11,01

Prominent cases--the estimation of Phillips curves, Euler equations, or monetary policy rules--have typically relied on using predetermined variables as instruments, with mixed success. In this work, we propose a new approach that consists in using sequences of independently identified structural shocks as instrumental variables. Our approach is robust to weak instruments and is valid regardless of the shocks' variance contribution. We estimate a Phillips curve using monetary shocks as instruments and find that conventional methods substantially underestimate the slope of the Phillips curve.","['Mesters, Geert', 'Barnichon, Regis']","['Model Construction and Estimation', 'Macroeconomics: Production', 'Price Level; Inflation; Deflation', 'Monetary Policy']","['C51', 'E23', 'E31', 'E52']",Identifying Modern Macro Equations with Old Shocks,0,0,0,0,0,2020,11,01

We study a static, multisector framework in which production is organized in an input-output network and production decisions are distorted. Sectoral distortions manifest at the aggregate level via two channels: total factor productivity (TFP) and the labor wedge. We show that near efficiency, distortions have zero first-order effects on TFP and nonzero first-order effects on the labor wedge, and that a sufficient statistic for the latter are the Domar weights. We thereby provide a Hulten-like theorem for the aggregate effects of sectoral distortions. A quantitative application of the model to the 2008-09 financial crisis suggests that the U.S. input-output structure amplified financial distortions by roughly a factor of two during the crisis.","[""La'O, Jennifer"", 'Bigio, Saki']","['General Aggregative Models: Social Accounting Matrix', 'Employment; Unemployment; Wages; Intergenerational Income Distribution; Aggregate Human Capital; Aggregate Labor Productivity', 'Financial Crises', 'Industrial Organization and Macroeconomics: Industrial Structure and Structural Change; Industrial Price Indices']","['E16', 'E24', 'G01', 'L16']",Distortions in Production Networks,1,0,0,0,0,2020,11,01
135,4,2020-11-01,"This article estimates the effect of environmental regulation on firm productivity using a spatial regression discontinuity design implicit in China's water quality monitoring system. Because water quality readings are important for political evaluations and the monitoring stations only capture emissions from their upstream regions, local government officials are incentivized to enforce tighter environmental standards on firms immediately upstream of a monitoring station, rather than those immediately downstream. Exploiting this discontinuity in regulation stringency with novel firm-level geocoded emission and production data sets, we find that immediate upstream polluters face a more than 24% reduction in total factor productivity (TFP), and a more than 57% reduction in chemical oxygen demand emissions, as compared with their immediate downstream counterparts. We find that the discontinuity in TFP does not exist in nonpolluting industries, only emerged after the government explicitly linked political promotion to water quality readings, and was predominantly driven by prefectural cities with career-driven leaders. Linking the TFP estimate with the emission estimate, a back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that China's water regulation efforts between 2000 and 2007 were associated with an economic cost of more than 800 billion Chinese yuan.","['Wang, Shaoda', 'He, Guojun', 'Zhang, Bing']","['Production; Cost; Capital; Capital, Total Factor, and Multifactor Productivity; Capacity', 'Economic Development: Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Other Primary Products', 'Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure', 'Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Natural Resources; Energy; Environment', 'Socialist Enterprises and Their Transitions', 'Air Pollution; Water Pollution; Noise; Hazardous Waste; Solid Waste; Recycling', 'Environmental Economics: Government Policy']","['D24', 'O13', 'O18', 'P28', 'P31', 'Q53', 'Q58']",Watering Down Environmental Regulation in China,0,0,0,0,0,2020,11,01

135,4,2020-11-01,"The strength of contract enforcement determines how firms source inputs and organize production. Using microdata on Indian manufacturing plants, we show that production and sourcing decisions appear systematically distorted in states with weaker enforcement. Specifically, we document that in industries that tend to rely more heavily on relationship-specific intermediate inputs, plants in states with more-congested courts shift their expenditures away from intermediate inputs and have a greater vertical span of production. To quantify the effect of these distortions on aggregate productivity, we construct a model in which plants have several ways of producing, each with different bundles of inputs. Weak enforcement exacerbates a holdup problem that arises when using inputs that require customization, distorting both the intensive and extensive margins of input use. The equilibrium organization of production and the network structure of input-output linkages arise endogenously from the producers' simultaneous cost-minimization decisions. We identify the structural parameters that govern enforcement frictions from cross-state variation in the first moments of producers' cost shares. A set of counterfactuals show that enforcement frictions lower aggregate productivity to an extent that is relevant on the macro scale.","['Oberfield, Ezra', 'Boehm, Johannes']","['Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Transactional Relationships; Contracts and Reputation; Networks', 'Organization of Production', 'Industry Studies: Manufacturing: General', 'Industrialization; Manufacturing and Service Industries; Choice of Technology', 'Empirical Studies of Economic Growth; Aggregate Productivity; Cross-Country Output Convergence']","['D22', 'L14', 'L23', 'L60', 'O14', 'O47']",Misallocation in the Market for Inputs: Enforcement and the Organization of Production,1,0,0,0,0,2020,11,01

The value of nonemployment is therefore a key determinant of wages. We measure the wage effect of changes in the value of nonemployment among initially employed workers. Our quasi-experimental variation in the value of nonemployment arises from four large reforms of unemployment insurance (UI) benefit levels in Austria. We document that wages are insensitive to UI benefit changes: point estimates imply a wage response of less than $0.01 per $1.00 UI benefit increase, and we can reject sensitivities larger than $0.03. The insensitivity holds even among workers with low wages and high predicted unemployment duration, and among job switchers hired out of unemployment. The insensitivity of wages to the nonemployment value presents a puzzle to the widely used Nash bargaining model, which predicts a sensitivity of $0.24-$0.48.

Members enrolled in insurance give significantly less money to their own church compared with members who only receive information about the insurance. Enrollment also reduces giving toward other spiritual goods. We set up a model exploring different channels of religiously based insurance. The implications of the model and the results from the dictator games suggest that adherents perceive the church as a source of insurance and that this insurance is derived from beliefs in an interventionist God.

135,3,2020-08-01,"We construct publicly available statistics on parents' incomes and students' earnings outcomes for each college in the United States using deidentified data from tax records. These statistics reveal that the degree of parental income segregation across colleges is very high, similar to that across neighborhoods. Differences in postcollege earnings between children from low- and high-income families are much smaller among students who attend the same college than across colleges. Colleges with the best earnings outcomes predominantly enroll students from high-income families, although a few mid-tier public colleges have both low parent income levels and high student earnings. Linking these income data to SAT and ACT scores, we simulate how changes in the allocation of students to colleges affect segregation and intergenerational mobility. Equalizing application, admission, and matriculation rates across parental income groups conditional on test scores would reduce segregation substantially, primarily by increasing the representation of middle-class students at more selective colleges. However, it would have little effect on the fraction of low-income students at elite private colleges because there are relatively few students from low-income families with sufficiently high SAT/ACT scores. Differences in parental income distributions across colleges could be eliminated by giving low- and middle-income students a sliding-scale preference in the application and admissions process similar to that implicitly given to legacy students at elite private colleges. Assuming that 80% of observational differences in students' earnings conditional on test scores, race, and parental income are due to colleges' causal effects--a strong assumption, but one consistent with prior work--such changes could reduce intergenerational income persistence among college students by about 25%. We conclude that changing how students are allocated to colleges could substantially reduce segregation and increase intergenerational mobility, even without changing colleges' educational programs.","['Yagan, Danny', 'Chetty, Raj', 'Friedman, John N.', 'Saez, Emmanuel', 'Turner, Nicholas']","['Higher Education; Research Institutions', 'Returns to Education', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Job, Occupational, and Intergenerational Mobility; Promotion']","['I23', 'I26', 'J31', 'J62']",Income Segregation and Intergenerational Mobility across Colleges in the United States,0,0,0,0,0,2020,08,01
135,3,2020-08-01,"We provide a continuous-time ""risk-centric"" representation of the New Keynesian model, which we use to analyze the interactions between asset prices, financial speculation, and macroeconomic outcomes when output is determined by aggregate demand. In principle, interest rate policy is highly effective in dealing with shocks to asset valuations. However, in practice monetary policy faces a wide range of constraints. If these constraints are severe, a decline in risky asset valuations generates a demand recession. This reduces earnings and generates a negative feedback loop between asset prices and aggregate demand. In the recession phase, average beliefs matter because they not only affect asset valuations but also determine the strength of the amplification mechanism. In the ex ante boom phase, belief disagreements (or heterogeneous asset valuations) matter because they induce investors to speculate. This speculation exacerbates the crash by reducing high-valuation investors' wealth when the economy transitions to recession, which depresses (wealth-weighted) average beliefs. Macroprudential policy that restricts speculation in the boom can Pareto improve welfare by increasing asset prices and aggregate demand in the recession.","['Simsek, Alp', 'Caballero, Ricardo J.']","['General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Post-Keynesian; Modern Monetary Theory', 'Macroeconomics: Production', 'Business Fluctuations; Cycles', 'Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy', 'Equities; Fixed Income Securities']","['E12', 'E23', 'E32', 'E44', 'G12']",A Risk-Centric Model of Demand Recessions and Speculation,0,0,0,0,0,2020,08,01

We introduce a novel measure of risk perceptions: the price of volatile stocks (PVSt), defined as the book-to-market ratio of low-volatility stocks minus the book-to-market ratio of high-volatility stocks. PVSt is high when perceived risk directly measured from surveys and option prices is low. Using our measure, we show that high perceived risk is associated with low risk-free interest rates, a high cost of capital for risky firms, and future declines in output and real investment. Perceived risk as measured by PVSt falls after positive macroeconomic news. These declines are predictably followed by upward revisions in perceived risk, indicating that fluctuations in investor risk perceptions are not fully rational.","['Sunderam, Adi', 'Siriwardane, Emil', 'Pflueger, Carolin']","['Investment; Capital; Intangible Capital; Capacity', 'Macroeconomics: Production', 'Business Fluctuations; Cycles', 'Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects', 'Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy', 'Capital Budgeting; Fixed Investment and Inventory Studies; Capacity']","['E22', 'E23', 'E32', 'E43', 'E44', 'G31']",Financial Market Risk Perceptions and the Macroeconomy,0,0,0,0,0,2020,08,01

Memory shapes valuation and decisions in two ways. First, recalled experiences form a norm, which serves as an initial anchor for valuation. Second, salient quality and price surprises relative to the norm lead to large adjustments in valuation. The model unifies many well-documented choice puzzles, including the attribution and projection biases, inattention to hidden attributes, background contrast effects, and context-dependent willingness to pay. Unifying these puzzles on the basis of selective memory and attention to surprise yields multiple new predictions.","['Shleifer, Andrei', 'Gennaioli, Nicola', 'Bordalo, Pedro']","['Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis', 'Micro-Based Behavioral Economics: Role and Effects of Psychological, Emotional, Social, and Cognitive Factors on Decision Making']","['D12', 'D91']","Memory, Attention, and Choice",0,0,0,0,0,2020,08,01

We find that stronger bargaining power and better outside options improve agents' outcomes. Robust empirical findings that existing models cannot rationalize include reciprocal (and gradual) concession behavior and delayed disagreement. Another robust pattern at odds with existing theory is that players exhibit a preference for making and accepting offers that split the difference between the two most recent offers.

For each policy, we use existing causal estimates to calculate the benefit that each policy provides its recipients (measured as their willingness to pay) and the policy's net cost, inclusive of long-term effects on the government's budget. We divide the willingness to pay by the net cost to the government to form each policy's Marginal Value of Public Funds, or its ""MVPF"". Comparing MVPFs across policies provides a unified method of assessing their effect on social welfare. Our results suggest that direct investments in low-income children's health and education have historically had the highest MVPFs, on average exceeding 5. Many such policies have paid for themselves as the government recouped the cost of their initial expenditures through additional taxes collected and reduced transfers. We find large MVPFs for education and health policies among children of all ages, rather than observing diminishing marginal returns throughout childhood. We find smaller MVPFs for policies targeting adults, generally between 0.5 and 2. Expenditures on adults have exceeded this MVPF range in particular if they induced large spillovers on children. We relate our estimates to existing theories of optimal government policy, and we discuss how the MVPF provides lessons for the design of future research.","['Sprung-Keyser, Ben', 'Hendren, Nathaniel']","['Taxation, Subsidies, and Revenue: General', 'National Government Expenditures and Health', 'National Government Expenditures and Education', 'National Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs', 'National Budget; Budget Systems', 'Education: Government Policy', 'Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs']","['H20', 'H51', 'H52', 'H53', 'H61', 'I28', 'I38']",A Unified Welfare Analysis of Government Policies,0,0,0,0,0,2020,08,01

We establish that the agent often simplifies her choices by restricting attention to a few important considerations, which depend on the decision at hand and affect her consumption patterns in specific ways. If the agent's problem is to choose the consumption levels of many goods with different degrees of substitutability, then she may create mental budgets for more substitutable products (e.g., entertainment). In some situations, it is optimal to specify budgets in terms of consumption quantities, but when most products have an abundance of substitutes, specifying budgets in terms of nominal spending tends to be optimal. If the goods are complements, in contrast, then the agent may--consistent with naive diversification--choose a fixed, unconsidered mix of products. And if the agent's problem is to choose one of multiple products to fulfill a given consumption need (e.g., for gasoline or a bed), then it is often optimal for her to allocate a fixed sum for the need.","['Koszegi, Botond', 'Matejka, Filip']","['Consumer Economics: Theory', 'Search; Learning; Information and Knowledge; Communication; Belief; Unawareness', 'Household Saving, Borrowing, Debt, and Wealth']","['D11', 'D83', 'G51']",Choice Simplification: A Theory of Mental Budgeting and Naive Diversification,0,0,0,0,0,2020,05,01

A treatment designed to have more traditional girls' empowerment effects had directionally positive but insignificant educational effects. Relative to this treatment, negotiation increased enrollment in higher-quality schooling and had larger effects for high-ability girls.

However, agricultural productivity growth can increase savings and the supply of capital, generating an expansion of the capital-intensive sector, manufacturing. We highlight this mechanism in a simple model and test its predictions in the context of a large and exogenous increase in agricultural productivity due to the adoption of genetically engineered soy in Brazil. We find that agricultural productivity growth generated an increase in savings, but these were not reinvested locally. Instead, there were capital outflows from rural areas. Capital reallocated toward urban regions, where it was invested in the industrial and service sectors. The degree of financial integration affected the speed of structural transformation. Regions that were more financially integrated with soy-producing areas through bank branch networks experienced faster growth in nonagricultural lending.

We estimate that the life insurance sector's aggregate benefit from FDA-approved immunotherapies is $9.8 billion a year.

135,2,2020-05-01,"This article explores the foundations of religious influence in politics and society. We show that an important Islamic institution fostered the entrenchment of Islamism at a critical juncture in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country. In the early 1960s, rural elites transferred large amounts of land into waqf--inalienable charitable trusts in Islamic law--to avoid expropriation by the state. Regions facing a greater threat of expropriation exhibit more prevalent waqf land and Islamic institutions endowed as such, including mosques and religious schools. These endowments provided conservative forces with the capital needed to promote Islamist ideology and mobilize against the secular state. We identify lasting effects of the transfers on the size of the religious sector, electoral support for Islamist parties, and the adoption of local sharia laws. These effects are shaped by greater demand for religion in government but not by greater piety among the electorate. Waqf assets also impose costs on the local economy, particularly in agriculture, where these endowments are associated with lower productivity.

A simple economic model provides an empirical framework to separate these explanations. Estimating this model with data for heart attack patients, we find evidence of substantial variation across hospitals in allocative inefficiency and comparative advantage, with most hospitals overusing treatment in part because of incorrect beliefs about their comparative advantage.

First, black Americans and American Indians have much lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to persistent disparities across generations. Conditional on parent income, the black-white income gap is driven by differences in wages and employment rates between black and white men; there are no such differences between black and white women. Hispanic Americans have rates of intergenerational mobility more similar to whites than blacks, leading the Hispanic-white income gap to shrink across generations. Second, differences in parental marital status, education, and wealth explain little of the black-white income gap conditional on parent income. Third, the black-white gap persists even among boys who grow up in the same neighborhood. Controlling for parental income, black boys have lower incomes in adulthood than white boys in 99% of Census tracts. The few areas with small black-white gaps tend to be low-poverty neighborhoods with low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among blacks. Black males who move to such neighborhoods earlier in childhood have significantly better outcomes. However, less than 5% of black children grow up in such areas.

We base our empirical analysis on more than 1,200 acquisitions of independent dialysis facilities by large chains over a 12-year period and find that chains transfer several prominent strategies to the facilities they acquire. Most notably, acquired facilities converge to the behavior of their new parent companies by increasing patients' doses of highly reimbursed drugs, replacing high-skill nurses with less-skilled technicians, and waitlisting fewer patients for kidney transplants. We then show that patients fare worse as a result of these changes: outcomes such as hospitalizations and mortality deteriorate, with our long panel allowing us to identify these effects from within-facility or within-patient variation around the acquisitions. Because overall Medicare spending increases at acquired facilities, mostly as a result of higher drug reimbursements, this decline in quality corresponds to a decline in value for payers. We conclude the article by considering the channels through which acquisitions produce such large changes in provider behavior and outcomes, finding that increased market power cannot explain the decline in quality. Rather, the adoption of the acquiring firm's strategies and practices drives our main results, with greater economies of scale for drug purchasing responsible for more than half of the change in profits following an acquisition.","['McDevitt, Ryan C.', 'Heebsh, Benjamin', 'Eliason, Paul J.', 'Roberts, James W.']","['Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Mergers; Acquisitions; Restructuring; Voting; Proxy Contests; Corporate Governance', 'Analysis of Health Care Markets', 'Health Behavior', 'Oligopoly and Other Imperfect Markets', 'Business Objectives of the Firm']","['D22', 'G34', 'I11', 'I12', 'L13', 'L21']",How Acquisitions Affect Firm Behavior and Performance: Evidence from the Dialysis Industry,1,0,0,0,1,2020,02,01

In the survey, a randomly chosen subset of firms is repeatedly treated with information about recent inflation whereas other firms are not. This information treatment generates exogenous variation in inflation expectations. We find that higher inflation expectations on the part of firms leads them to raise their prices, increase demand for credit, and reduce their employment and capital. However, when policy rates are constrained by the effective lower bound, demand effects are stronger, leading firms to raise their prices more and no longer reduce their employment.","['Gorodnichenko, Yuriy', 'Coibion, Olivier', 'Ropele, Tiziano']","['Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Expectations; Speculations', 'Price Level; Inflation; Deflation', 'Bankruptcy; Liquidation', 'Labor Demand']","['D22', 'D84', 'E31', 'G33', 'J23']",Inflation Expectations and Firm Decisions: New Causal Evidence,0,0,0,0,0,2020,02,01

We provide nonparametric formulas for aggregating microeconomic shocks in economies with distortions such as taxes, markups, frictions to resource reallocation, financial frictions, and nominal rigidities. We allow for arbitrary elasticities of substitution, returns to scale, factor mobility, and input-output network linkages. We show how to separately measure changes in technical and allocative efficiency. We also show how to compute the social cost of distortions. We pursue applications focusing on firm-level markups in the United States. We find that improvement in allocative efficiency, due to the reallocation over time of market share to high-markup firms, accounts for about half of aggregate TFP growth over the period 1997-2015. We also find that eliminating the misallocation resulting from the large and dispersed markups estimated in the data would raise aggregate TFP by about 15 percent, increasing the economy-wide cost of monopoly distortions by two orders of magnitude compared with the famous 0.1 percent estimate by Harberger (1954). These exact numbers should be interpreted with care because the data are imperfect and require substantial imputation.","['Baqaee, David Rezza', 'Farhi, Emmanuel']","['Production; Cost; Capital; Capital, Total Factor, and Multifactor Productivity; Capacity', 'Factor Income Distribution', 'Market Structure, Pricing, and Design: Oligopoly and Other Forms of Market Imperfection', 'General Equilibrium and Disequilibrium: Input-Output Tables and Analysis', 'One, Two, and Multisector Growth Models']","['D24', 'D33', 'D43', 'D57', 'O41']",Productivity and Misallocation in General Equilibrium,0,0,1,0,0,2020,02,01

This policy made 86 percent of cash in circulation illegal tender overnight, with new notes gradually introduced over the next several months. We present a model of demonetization where agents hold cash both to satisfy a cash-in-advance constraint and for tax evasion purposes. We test the predictions of the model in the cross-section of Indian districts using several novel data sets including: the geographic distribution of demonetized and new notes for causal inference; night light activity and employment surveys to measure economic activity including in the informal sector; debit/credit cards and e-wallet transactions data; and banking data on deposit and credit growth. Districts experiencing more severe demonetization had relative reductions in economic activity, faster adoption of alternative payment technologies, and lower bank credit growth. The cross-sectional responses cumulate to a contraction in aggregate employment and night lights-based output due to the the cash shortage of at least 2 percentage points and of bank credit of 2 percentage points in 2016Q4 relative to their counterfactual paths, effects that dissipate over the next few months.

We analyze the short-run impact of this return to protectionism on the U.S. economy. Import and retaliatory tariffs caused large declines in imports and exports. Prices of imports targeted by tariffs did not fall, implying complete pass-through of tariffs to duty-inclusive prices. The resulting losses to U.S. consumers and firms that buy imports was $51 billion, or 0.27 percent of GDP. We embed the estimated trade elasticities in a general-equilibrium model of the U.S. economy. After accounting for tariff revenue and gains to domestic producers, the aggregate real income loss was $7.2 billion, or 0.04 percent of GDP. Import tariffs favored sectors concentrated in politically competitive counties, and the model implies that tradeable-sector workers in heavily Republican counties were the most negatively affected due to the retaliatory tariffs.","['Goldberg, Pinelopi K.', 'Kennedy, Patrick J.', 'Khandelwal, Amit K.', 'Fajgelbaum, Pablo D.']","['Macroeconomics: Production', 'Trade Policy; International Trade Organizations', 'Size and Spatial Distributions of Regional Economic Activity']","['E23', 'F13', 'R12']",The Return to Protectionism,0,0,0,0,0,2020,02,01

136,2,2021-05-01,"Most convicted offenders serve their sentences under ""community supervision"" at home instead of in prison. Under supervision, however, a technical rule violation, such as not paying fees, can result in incarceration. Rule violations account for 25% of prison admissions nationally and are significantly more common among black offenders. I test whether technical rules are effective tools for identifying likely reoffenders and deterring crime and examine their disparate racial impacts using administrative data from North Carolina. Analysis of a 2011 reform reducing prison punishments for technical violations on probation reveals that 40% of rule breakers would go on to commit crimes if spared harsh punishment. The same reform also closed a 33% black-white gap in incarceration rates without substantially increasing the black-white reoffending gap. These effects combined imply that technical rules target riskier probationers overall but disproportionately affect low-risk black offenders. To justify black probationers' higher violation rate on efficiency grounds, their crimes must be roughly twice as socially costly as that of white probationers. Exploiting the repeat spell nature of the North Carolina data, I estimate a semiparametric competing risks model that allows me to distinguish the effects of particular types of technical rules from unobserved probationer heterogeneity. Rules related to the payment of fees and fines, which are common in many states, are ineffective in tagging likely reoffenders and drive differential effects by race. These findings illustrate the potentially large influence of ostensibly race-neutral policies on racial disparities in the justice system.","['Rose, Evan K.']","['State and Local Government: Other Expenditure Categories', 'Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law']","['H76', 'J15', 'K42']",Who Gets a Second Chance?

The perceived quality of health services may be especially critical during epidemics, when people choose whether to cooperate with response efforts and frontline health workers. Can improving the perceived quality of health care promote community health and ultimately help to contain epidemics? We leverage a field experiment in Sierra Leone to answer this question in the context of the 2014 West African Ebola crisis. Two years before the outbreak, we randomly assigned two interventions to government-run health clinics--one focused on community monitoring, and the other conferred nonfinancial awards to clinic staff. Prior to the Ebola crisis, both interventions increased clinic utilization and patient satisfaction. Community monitoring additionally improved child health, leading to 38% fewer deaths of children under age five. Later, during the crisis, the interventions also increased reporting of Ebola cases by 62%, and community monitoring significantly reduced Ebola-related deaths. Evidence on mechanisms suggests that both interventions improved the perceived quality of health care, encouraging patients to report Ebola symptoms and receive medical care. Improvements in health outcomes under community monitoring suggest that these changes partly reflect a rise in the underlying quality of administered care. Overall, our results indicate that promoting accountability not only has the power to improve health systems during normal times, but can also make them more resilient to emergent crises.","['Siddiqi, Bilal', 'Christensen, Darin', 'Dube, Oeindrila', 'Haushofer, Johannes', 'Voors, Maarten']","['National Government Expenditures and Health', 'Analysis of Health Care Markets', 'Health Behavior', 'Health: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health', 'Economic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration']","['H51', 'I11', 'I12', 'I18', 'O15']",Building Resilient Health Systems: Experimental Evidence from Sierra Leone and the 2014 Ebola Outbreak,0,0,0,0,0,2021,05,01

Difficulties with measuring relational contracts and dealing with the endogeneity of competition have frustrated attempts to answer this question. We make progress by studying relational contracts between upstream farmers and downstream mills in Rwanda's coffee industry. First, we identify salient dimensions of their relational contracts and measure them through an original survey of mills and farmers. Second, we take advantage of an engineering model for the optimal placement of mills to construct an instrument that isolates geographically determined variation in competition. Conditional on the suitability for mills' placement in the catchment area, we find that mills surrounded by more suitable areas (i) face more competition from other mills, (ii) use fewer relational contracts with farmers, and (iii) exhibit worse performance. An additional competing mill also (iv) reduces the aggregate quantity of coffee supplied to mills by farmers and (v) makes farmers worse off. Competition hampers relational contracts directly by increasing farmers' temptation to default on the relational contract and indirectly by reducing mills' profits.","['Morjaria, Ameet', 'Macchiavello, Rocco']","['Economics of Contract: Theory', 'Transactional Relationships; Contracts and Reputation; Networks', 'Food; Beverages; Cosmetics; Tobacco; Wine and Spirits', 'Economic Development: Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Other Primary Products', 'Micro Analysis of Farm Firms, Farm Households, and Farm Input Markets', 'Agricultural Markets and Marketing; Cooperatives; Agribusiness']","['D86', 'L14', 'L66', 'O13', 'Q12', 'Q13']",Competition and Relational Contracts in the Rwanda Coffee Chain,1,0,0,0,0,2021,05,01

Using micro-level data, we document five salient facts: (i) since the 1980s, there has been a dramatic reallocation of value added toward the lower end of the labor share distribution; (ii) this aggregate reallocation is not due to entry/exit, to ""superstars"" growing faster, or to large establishments lowering their labor shares, but is instead due to units whose labor share fell as they grew in size; (iii) low labor share (LL) establishments benefit from high revenue labor productivity, not low wages; (iv) they also enjoy a product price premium relative to their peers; and (v) they have only temporarily lower labor shares that rebound after five to eight years. This transient pattern has become more pronounced over time, and the dynamics of value added and employment are increasingly disconnected.

136,2,2021-05-01,"We examine whether integrating men and women in a traditionally male-dominated environment can change men's attitudes about mixed-gender productivity, gender roles, and gender identity. Our context is the military in Norway, where we randomly assigned female recruits to some squads but not others during boot camp. We find that living and working with women for eight weeks causes men to have more egalitarian attitudes. There is a 14 percentage point higher fraction of men who think mixed-gender teams perform as well or better than same-gender teams, an 8 percentage point increase in men who think household work should be shared equally, and a 14 percentage point increase in men who do not completely disavow feminine traits. Moreover, men in mixed-gender teams are more likely to choose military occupations immediately after boot camp that have a higher fraction of women in them. But these effects do not persist once treatment stops. Treated men's attitudes converge to those of the controls in a six-month follow-up survey, and there is no long-term effect on choosing fields of study, occupations, or workplaces with a higher fraction of women after military service ends. Contrary to the predictions of many policy makers, we do not find that integrating women into squads hurt male recruits' performance or satisfaction with service, either during boot camp or their subsequent military assignment. These findings provide evidence that even in a highly gender-skewed environment, gender stereotypes are malleable and can be altered by integrating members of the opposite sex. But they also suggest that without continuing intensive exposure, effects are unlikely to persist.","['Dahl, Gordon B.', 'Rooth, Dan-Olof', 'Kotsadam, Andreas']","['Micro-Based Behavioral Economics: Role and Effects of Psychological, Emotional, Social, and Cognitive Factors on Decision Making', 'Economics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Public Sector Labor Markets', 'Personnel Economics: Labor Management']","['D91', 'J16', 'J45', 'M54']",Does Integration Change Gender Attitudes?

Consequently, it is rare for a Bayesian to frequently shift beliefs substantially while remaining relatively uncertain, or, conversely, become very confident with relatively little belief movement. We formalize this intuition by developing specific measures of movement and uncertainty reduction given a Bayesian's changing beliefs over time, showing that these measures are equal in expectation and creating consequent statistical tests for Bayesianess. We then show connections between these two core concepts and four common psychological biases, suggesting that the test might be particularly good at detecting these biases. We provide support for this conclusion by simulating the performance of our test and other martingale tests.

Search models predict that until benefit exhaustion, UI depresses job search effort and increases reservation wages. Over an unemployment spell, search effort should increase up to benefit exhaustion and stay high thereafter. Meanwhile, reservation wages should decrease up to benefit exhaustion and stay low thereafter. To test these predictions, we link administrative registers to data on job search behavior from a major online job search platform in France. We follow over 400,000 workers, as long as they remain unemployed. We analyze the changes in search behavior around benefits exhaustion and take two steps to isolate the individual response to unemployment benefits. First, our longitudinal data allows us to correct for changes in sample composition over the spell. Second, we exploit data on workers eligible for 12-24 months of UI as well as workers ineligible for UI, to control for behavior changes over the unemployment spell that are independent of UI. Our results confirm the predictions of search models. We find that search effort (the number of job applications) increases by at least 50% during the year preceding benefits exhaustion and remains high thereafter. The target monthly wage decreases by at least 2.4% during the year preceding benefits exhaustion and remains low thereafter. In addition, we provide evidence for duration dependence: workers decrease the wage they target by 1.5% over each year of unemployment, irrespective of their UI status.","['Marinescu, Ioana', 'Skandalis, Daphne']","['Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Unemployment: Models, Duration, Incidence, and Job Search', 'Unemployment Insurance; Severance Pay; Plant Closings']","['J31', 'J64', 'J65']",Unemployment Insurance and Job Search Behavior,0,0,0,0,0,2021,05,01

This difference in trade policy creates a global implicit subsidy to CO2 emissions in internationally traded goods and contributes to climate change. This global implicit subsidy to CO2 emissions totals several hundred billion dollars annually. The greater protection of downstream industries, which are relatively clean, substantially accounts for this pattern. The downstream pattern can be explained by theories where industries lobby for low tariffs on their inputs but final consumers are poorly organized. A quantitative general equilibrium model suggests that if countries applied similar trade policies to clean and dirty goods, global CO2 emissions would decrease and global real income would change little.","['Shapiro, Joseph S.']","['Trade Policy; International Trade Organizations', 'Empirical Studies of Trade', 'Trade and Environment', 'Climate; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Global Warming', 'Environment and Development; Environment and Trade; Sustainability; Environmental Accounts and Accounting; Environmental Equity; Population Growth']","['F13', 'F14', 'F18', 'Q54', 'Q56']",The Environmental Bias of Trade Policy,0,0,0,0,0,2021,05,01

The equity values are positively correlated with business incomes and standard measures of markups based on accounting data, but not with owners' financial assets or standard measures of business total factor productivity.

We validate our measure by showing that it correctly identifies calls containing extensive conversations on risks that are political in nature, that it varies intuitively over time and across sectors, and that it correlates with the firm's actions and stock market volatility in a manner that is highly indicative of political risk. Firms exposed to political risk retrench hiring and investment and actively lobby and donate to politicians. These results continue to hold after controlling for news about the mean (as opposed to the variance) of political shocks. Interestingly, the vast majority of the variation in our measure is at the firm level rather than at the aggregate or sector level, in the sense that it is captured neither by the interaction of sector and time fixed effects nor by heterogeneous exposure of individual firms to aggregate political risk. The dispersion of this firm-level political risk increases significantly at times with high aggregate political risk.

We conduct a placebo exercise in which we estimate the effect of a shift-share regressor constructed with randomly generated sectoral shocks on actual labor market outcomes across U.S. commuting zones. Tests based on commonly used standard errors with 5 percent nominal significance level reject the null of no effect in up to 55 percent of the placebo samples.

I analyze industrial policy when economic sectors form a production network via input-output linkages. Market imperfections generate distortionary effects that compound through backward demand linkages, causing upstream sectors to become the sink for imperfections and have the greatest size distortions. My key finding is that the distortion in sectoral size is a sufficient statistic for the social value of promoting that sector; thus, there is an incentive for a well-meaning government to subsidize upstream sectors. Furthermore, sectoral interventions' aggregate effects can be simply summarized, to first order, by the cross-sector covariance between my sufficient statistic and subsidy spending. My sufficient statistic predicts sectoral policies in South Korea in the 1970s and modern-day China, suggesting that sectoral interventions might have generated positive aggregate effects in these economies.","['Liu, Ernest']","['Production; Cost; Capital; Capital, Total Factor, and Multifactor Productivity; Capacity', 'General Equilibrium and Disequilibrium: Input-Output Tables and Analysis', 'Industrial Policy; Sectoral Planning Methods', 'Industrial Policy', 'Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population']","['D24', 'D57', 'L52', 'O25', 'P23']",Industrial Policies in Production Networks,1,0,0,0,0,2019,11,01

A primary source of top income is private ""pass-through"" business profit, which can include entrepreneurial labor income for tax reasons. This article asks whether top pass-through profit mostly reflects human capital, defined as all inalienable factors embodied in business owners, rather than financial capital. Tax data linking 11 million firms to their owners show that top pass-through profit accrues to working-age owners of closely held mid-market firms in skill-intensive industries. Pass-through profit falls by three-quarters after owner retirement or premature death. Classifying three-quarters of pass-through profit as human capital income, we find that the typical top earner derives most of her income from human capital, not financial capital. Growth in pass-through profit is explained by both rising productivity and a rising share of value added accruing to owners.","['Zidar, Owen', 'Yagan, Danny', 'Zwick, Eric', 'Smith, Matthew']","['Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions', 'Financing Policy; Financial Risk and Risk Management; Capital and Ownership Structure; Value of Firms; Goodwill', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Entrepreneurship']","['D31', 'G32', 'J24', 'L26']",Capitalists in the Twenty-First Century,1,0,0,0,0,2019,11,01

This paper studies the interaction between corrective and redistributive motives in a general optimal taxation framework and delivers empirically implementable formulas for sufficient statistics for the optimal commodity tax. The optimal sin tax is increasing in the price elasticity of demand, increasing in the degree to which lower-income consumers are more biased or more elastic to the tax, decreasing in the extent to which consumption is concentrated among the poor, and decreasing in income effects, because income effects imply that commodity taxes create labor supply distortions. Contrary to common intuitions, stronger preferences for redistribution can increase the optimal sin tax, if lower-income consumers are more responsive to taxes or are more biased. As an application, we estimate the optimal nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, using Nielsen Homescan data and a specially designed survey measuring nutrition knowledge and self-control. Holding federal income tax rates constant, our estimates imply an optimal federal sugar-sweetened beverage tax of 1 to 2.1 cents per ounce, although optimal city-level taxes could be as much as 60% lower due to cross-border shopping.","['Taubinsky, Dmitry', 'Allcott, Hunt', 'Lockwood, Benjamin B.']","['Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency; Optimal Taxation', 'Taxation and Subsidies: Incidence', 'Business Taxes and Subsidies including sales and value-added (VAT)', 'Food; Beverages; Cosmetics; Tobacco; Wine and Spirits']","['H21', 'H22', 'H25', 'L66']","Regressive Sin Taxes, with an Application to the Optimal Soda Tax",1,0,0,0,0,2019,08,01

We first estimate the effect of the minimum wage increase on employment changes by wage bins throughout the hourly wage distribution. We then focus on the bottom part of the wage distribution and compare the number of excess jobs paying at or slightly above the new minimum wage to the missing jobs paying below it to infer the employment effect. We find that the overall number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged over the five years following the increase. At the same time, the direct effect of the minimum wage on average earnings was amplified by modest wage spillovers at the bottom of the wage distribution. Our estimates by detailed demographic groups show that the lack of job loss is not explained by labor-labor substitution at the bottom of the wage distribution. We also find no evidence of disemployment when we consider higher levels of minimum wages. However, we do find some evidence of reduced employment in tradeable sectors.

We infer the causal effects of patent allowances by comparing firms whose patent applications were initially allowed to those whose patent applications were initially rejected. To identify patents that are ex ante valuable, we extrapolate the excess stock return estimates of Kogan et al. (2017) to the full set of accepted and rejected patent applications based on predetermined firm and patent application characteristics. An initial allowance of an ex ante valuable patent generates substantial increases in firm productivity and worker compensation. By contrast, initial allowances of lower ex ante value patents yield no detectable effects on firm outcomes. Patent allowances lead firms to increase employment, but entry wages and workforce composition are insensitive to patent decisions. On average, workers capture roughly 30 cents of every dollar of patent-induced surplus in higher earnings. This share is roughly twice as high among workers present since the year of application. These earnings effects are concentrated among men and workers in the top half of the earnings distribution and are paired with corresponding improvements in worker retention among these groups. We interpret these earnings responses as reflecting the capture of economic rents by senior workers, who are most costly for innovative firms to replace.","['Zidar, Owen', 'Kline, Patrick', 'Petkova, Neviana', 'Williams, Heidi']","['Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Production; Cost; Capital; Capital, Total Factor, and Multifactor Productivity; Capacity', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Compensation Packages; Payment Methods', 'Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital']","['D22', 'D24', 'J24', 'J33', 'O34']",Who Profits from Patents?

According to an influential body of theories in psychology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology, the answer is that humans have evolved moral systems: packages of functional psychological and biological mechanisms that regulate economic behavior, including a belief in moralizing gods; moral values; negative reciprocity; and emotions of shame, guilt, and disgust. Based on a stylized model, this article empirically studies the structure and evolution of these moral traits as a function of historical heterogeneity in extended kinship relationships. The evidence shows that societies with a historically tightly knit kinship structure regulate behavior through communal moral values, revenge taking, emotions of external shame, and notions of purity and disgust. In loose kinship societies, on the other hand, cooperation appears to be enforced through universal moral values, internalized guilt, altruistic punishment, and an apparent rise and fall of moralizing religions. These patterns point to the presence of internally consistent but culturally variable functional moral systems. Consistent with the model, the relationship between kinship ties, economic development, and the structure of the mediating moral systems amplified over time.","['Enke, Benjamin']","['Microeconomic Behavior: Underlying Principles', 'Economic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Language; Social and Economic Stratification']","['D01', 'Z13']","Kinship, Cooperation, and the Evolution of Moral Systems",0,0,0,0,0,2019,05,01

We isolate strategic default by focusing on unanticipated rises at the time of delivery after production decisions are sunk and suppliers have been paid. Estimates suggest that roughly half of the observed defaults are strategic. We model how strategic default introduces a trade-off between insurance and counterparty risk: relative to indexed contracts, fixed-price contracts insure against price swings but create incentives to default when market conditions change.

To understand general equilibrium (GE) effects of these changes in behavior, we vary the density of loan offers across locations. We document significant effects of the credit intervention on seasonal price fluctuations in local grain markets, and show that these GE effects shape individual-level profitability estimates. In contrast to existing experimental work, the results indicate a setting in which microcredit can improve firm profitability, and suggest that GE effects can substantially shape microcredit's effectiveness.

134,2,2019-05-01,"We characterize the factors that determine who becomes an inventor in the United States, focusing on the role of inventive ability (""nature"") versus environment (""nurture""). Using deidentified data on 1.2 million inventors from patent records linked to tax records, we first show that children's chances of becoming inventors vary sharply with characteristics at birth, such as their race, gender, and parents' socioeconomic class. For example, children from high-income (top 1 percent) families are 10 times as likely to become inventors as those from below-median income families. These gaps persist even among children with similar math test scores in early childhood--which are highly predictive of innovation rates--suggesting that the gaps may be driven by differences in environment rather than abilities to innovate. We directly establish the importance of environment by showing that exposure to innovation during childhood has significant causal effects on children's propensities to invent. Children whose families move to a high-innovation area when they are young are more likely to become inventors. These exposure effects are technology class and gender specific. Children who grow up in a neighborhood or family with a high innovation rate in a specific technology class are more likely to patent in exactly the same class. Girls are more likely to invent in a particular class if they grow up in an area with more women (but not men) who invent in that class. These gender- and technology class-specific exposure effects are more likely to be driven by narrow mechanisms, such as role-model or network effects, than factors that only affect general human capital accumulation, such as the quality of schools. Consistent with the importance of exposure effects in career selection, women and disadvantaged youth are as underrepresented among high-impact inventors as they are among inventors as a whole.

We find that the often cited post-Bretton Woods transition from fixed to flexible arrangements is overstated; regimes with limited flexibility remain in the majority. Even if central bankers' communications jargon has evolved considerably in recent decades, it is apparent that many still place a large implicit weight on the exchange rate. The U.S. dollar scores as the world's dominant anchor currency by a very large margin. By some metrics, its use is far wider today than 70 years ago. In contrast, the global role of the euro appears to have stalled. We argue that in addition to the usual safe assets story, the record accumulation of reserves since 2002 may also have to do with many countries' desire to stabilize exchange rates in an environment of markedly reduced exchange rate restrictions or, more broadly, capital controls: an important amendment to the conventional portrayal of the macroeconomic trilemma.","['Rogoff, Kenneth S.', 'Ilzetzki, Ethan', 'Reinhart, Carmen M.']","['Monetary Systems; Standards; Regimes; Government and the Monetary System; Payment Systems', 'Central Banks and Their Policies', 'Foreign Exchange', 'International Monetary Arrangements and Institutions', 'International Linkages to Development; Role of International Organizations']","['E42', 'E58', 'F31', 'F33', 'O19']",Exchange Arrangements Entering the Twenty-First Century: Which Anchor Will Hold?,0,0,0,0,0,2019,05,01

The Jesuit order founded religious missions in 1609 among the Guarani, in modern-day Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. Before their expulsion in 1767, missionaries instructed indigenous inhabitants in reading, writing, and various crafts. Using archival records, as well as data at the individual and municipal level, I show that in areas of former Jesuit presence--within the Guarani area--educational attainment was higher and remains so (by 10 percent-15 percent) 250 years later. These educational differences have also translated into incomes that are 10 percent higher today. The identification of the positive effect of the Guarani Jesuit missions emerges after comparing them with abandoned Jesuit missions and neighboring Franciscan Guarani missions.

For a class of menu cost models, we derive several predictions about how price-setting changes with inflation at very high and at near-zero inflation rates. Then, we present evidence supporting these predictions using product-level data underlying Argentina's consumer price index from 1988 to 1997--a unique experience where monthly inflation ranged from almost 200 percent to less than zero. For low inflation rates, we find that (i) the frequency and absolute size of price changes as well as the dispersion of relative prices do not change with inflation, (ii) the frequency and size of price increases and decreases are symmetric around zero inflation, and (iii) aggregate inflation changes are mostly driven by changes in the frequency of price increases and decreases, as opposed to the size of price changes. For high inflation rates, we find that (iv) the elasticity of the frequency of price changes with respect to inflation is close to two-thirds, (v) the frequency of price changes across different products becomes similar, and (vi) the elasticity of the dispersion of relative prices with respect to inflation is one-third. Our findings confirm and extend available evidence for countries that experienced either very high or near-zero inflation. We conclude by showing that a hyperinflation of 500 percent a year is associated with a cost of approximately 8.5 percent of aggregate output a year as a result of inefficient price dispersion alone.","['Beraja, Martin', 'Neumeyer, Pablo Andres', 'Gonzalez-Rozada, Martin', 'Alvarez, Fernando']","['Macroeconomics: Production', 'Price Level; Inflation; Deflation', 'Production, Pricing, and Market Structure; Size Distribution of Firms', 'Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development']","['E23', 'E31', 'L11', 'O11']",From Hyperinflation to Stable Prices: Argentina's Evidence on Menu Cost Models,1,0,0,0,0,2019,02,01

We propose a decomposition of these violations into a cross-currency, a between-time-and-currency, and a cross-time component that allows us to analytically relate regression-based and portfolio-based facts and to estimate the joint restrictions they put on models of currency returns. Subject to standard assumptions on investors' information sets, we find that the forward premium puzzle (FPP) and the ""dollar trade"" anomaly are intimately linked: both are driven almost exclusively by the cross-time component. By contrast, the ""carry trade"" anomaly is driven largely by cross-sectional violations of UIP. The simplest model that the data do not reject features a cross-sectional asymmetry that makes some currencies pay permanently higher expected returns than others, and larger time series variation in expected returns on the U.S. dollar than on other currencies. Importantly, conventional estimates of the FPP are not directly informative about expected returns because they do not correct for uncertainty about future mean interest rates. Once we correct for this uncertainty, we never reject the null that investors expect high-interest-rate currencies to depreciate, not appreciate.","['Mano, Rui C.', 'Hassan, Tarek A.']","['Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects', 'Foreign Exchange', 'International Financial Markets']","['E43', 'F31', 'G15']",Forward and Spot Exchange Rates in a Multi-currency World,0,0,0,0,0,2019,02,01

Second, the Clean Water Act's grants to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which account for $650 billion in expenditure, caused some of these declines. Through these grants, it cost around $1.5 million (2014 dollars) to make one river-mile fishable for a year. We find little displacement of municipal expenditure due to a federal grant.

Output-sharing rules that make farmers less-than-full residual claimants are seen as a potentially important driver of low agricultural productivity. We report results from a field experiment designed to estimate and understand the effects of sharecropping contracts on agricultural input choices, risk-taking, and output. The experiment induced variation in the terms of sharecropping contracts. After agreeing to pay 50 percent of their output to the landlord, tenants were randomized into three groups: (i) some kept 50 percent of their output; (ii) others kept 75 percent; (iii) others kept 50 percent of output and received a lump-sum payment at the end of their contract, either fixed or stochastic. We find that tenants with higher output shares used more inputs, cultivated riskier crops, and produced 60 percent more output relative to control. Income or risk exposure have at most a small effect on farm output; the increase in output should be interpreted as an incentive effect of the output-sharing rule.","['Gulesci, Selim', 'Sulaiman, Munshi', 'Lerva, Benedetta', 'Burchardi, Konrad B.']","['Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design', 'Economic Development: Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Other Primary Products', 'Micro Analysis of Farm Firms, Farm Households, and Farm Input Markets']","['D82', 'O13', 'Q12']",Moral Hazard: Experimental Evidence from Tenancy Contracts,0,0,0,0,0,2019,02,01

Answering this question is challenging because U.S. law extends benefits for states experiencing high unemployment.

Using only the variation coming from measurement error, we find that benefit extensions have a limited influence on state-level macroeconomic outcomes.

These firms also purchased slightly more land. In return, the provincial party secretaries who provided the discount to these ""princeling"" firms are 23.4 percent more likely to be promoted to positions of national leadership.

Accordingly, this crackdown on corruption has also significantly reduced the promotional prospects of those local officials who rely on supplying a discount to get ahead.","['Kung, James Kai-sing', 'Chen, Ting']","['Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'Intergovernmental Relations; Federalism; Secession', 'Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law', 'Formal and Informal Sectors; Shadow Economy; Institutional Arrangements', 'Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Urban, Rural, and Regional Economics', 'Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Legal Institutions; Illegal Behavior']","['D22', 'D72', 'H77', 'K42', 'O17', 'P25', 'P37']",Busting the 'Princelings': The Campaign against Corruption in China's Primary Land Market,0,1,0,0,0,2019,02,01

We build a heterogeneous household model of refinancing with mortgage borrowers and lenders and use it to explore the monetary policy implications arising from our regional evidence. We find that the 2008 equity distribution made spending in depressed regions less responsive to interest rate cuts, thus dampening aggregate stimulus and increasing regional consumption inequality, whereas the opposite occurred in some earlier recessions.

Health spending per privately insured beneficiary differs by a factor of three across geographic areas and has a very low correlation with Medicare spending. For the privately insured, half of the spending variation is driven by price variation across regions, and half is driven by quantity variation. Prices vary substantially across regions, across hospitals within regions, and even within hospitals. For example, even for a nearly homogeneous service such as lower-limb magnetic resonance imaging, about a fifth of the total case-level price variation occurs within a hospital in the cross section. Hospital market structure is strongly associated with price levels and contract structure. Prices at monopoly hospitals are 12 percent higher than those in markets with four or more rivals. Monopoly hospitals also have contracts that load more risk on insurers (e.g., they have more cases with prices set as a share of their charges). In concentrated insurer markets the opposite occurs-hospitals have lower prices and bear more financial risk. Examining the 366 mergers and acquisitions that occurred between 2007 and 2011, we find that prices increased by over 6 percent when the merging hospitals were geographically close (e.g., 5 miles or less apart), but not when the hospitals were geographically distant (e.g., over 25 miles apart).","['Gaynor, Martin', 'Craig, Stuart V.', 'Cooper, Zack', 'Van Reenen, John']","['Insurance; Insurance Companies; Actuarial Studies', 'National Government Expenditures and Health', 'Analysis of Health Care Markets', 'Health Insurance, Public and Private', 'Health: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health']","['G22', 'H51', 'I11', 'I13', 'I18']",The Price Ain't Right?

We find that one-third of the rise in the variance of (log) earnings occurred within firms, whereas two-thirds of the rise occurred due to a rise in the dispersion of average earnings between firms. However, this rising between-firm variance is not accounted for by the firms themselves but by a widening gap between firms in the composition of their workers. This compositional change can be split into two roughly equal parts: high-wage workers became increasingly likely to work in high-wage firms (i.e., sorting increased), and high-wage workers became increasingly likely to work with each other (i.e., segregation rose). In contrast, we do not find a rise in the variance of firm-specific pay once we control for the worker composition in firms. Finally, we find that two-thirds of the rise in the within-firm variance of earnings occurred within mega (10,000+ employee) firms, which saw a particularly large increase in the variance of earnings compared with smaller firms.","['Bloom, Nicholas', 'Guvenen, Fatih', 'von Wachter, Till', 'Song, Jae', 'Price, David J.']","['Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Firm Performance: Size, Diversification, and Scope', 'Personnel Economics: Compensation and Compensation Methods and Their Effects']","['D31', 'J31', 'L25', 'M52']",Firming Up Inequality,1,0,0,0,0,2019,02,01

We also show that the social optimum can be implemented by a realistic market equilibrium where the organizers set up trading sites to direct the other side's search. The results provide a unified explanation for why trade has often been organized by sellers in the goods market, by buyers (firms) in the labor market, and by both sides in the asset market.

The hold-up narrative, however, runs counter to evidence in many retail settings where ancillary good prices are set below cost (e.g., free shipping or limited card surcharging in countries where the ""no-surcharge rule"" was lifted). We argue that the key to unifying these conflicting narratives is that the seller may absorb partly or fully the ancillary good's cost so as not to miss sales on the basic good. A supplier with market power on the ancillary good market then takes advantage of cost absorption and jacks up its wholesale price. Hold-ups occur only when consumers are initially uninformed or naive about the drip price and shopping costs are high. The price of the basic good then acts as a signal of the drip price, since a high markup on the basic good makes the firm more wary of missed sales. Regardless of whether consumers are informed, uninformed but rational, or naive, mandating price transparency and banning loss-making on the ancillary good leads to (i) an efficient consumption of the ancillary good, and (ii) a reduction of its wholesale price, generating strict welfare gains.","['Tirole, Jean', 'Gomes, Renato']","['Firm Behavior: Theory', 'Search; Learning; Information and Knowledge; Communication; Belief; Unawareness', 'Production, Pricing, and Market Structure; Size Distribution of Firms', 'Firm Performance: Size, Diversification, and Scope', 'Retail and Wholesale Trade; e-Commerce']","['D21', 'D83', 'L11', 'L25', 'L81']",Missed Sales and the Pricing of Ancillary Goods,1,0,0,0,0,2018,11,01

To understand this process, we propose a conceptual framework in which the introduction of religious competition shifts political markets where religious authorities provide legitimacy to rulers in exchange for control over resources. Consistent with our framework, religious competition changed the balance of power between secular and religious elites: secular authorities acquired enormous amounts of wealth from monasteries closed during the Reformation, particularly in Protestant regions. This transfer of resources had significant consequences. First, it shifted the allocation of upper-tail human capital. Graduates of Protestant universities increasingly took secular, especially administrative, occupations. Protestant university students increasingly studied secular subjects, especially degrees that prepared students for public sector jobs, rather than church sector specific theology. Second, it affected the sectoral composition of fixed investment. Particularly in Protestant regions, new construction shifted from religious toward secular purposes, especially the building of palaces and administrative buildings, which reflected the increased wealth and power of secular lords. Reallocation was not driven by preexisting economic or cultural differences. Our findings indicate that the Reformation played an important causal role in the secularization of the West.","['Yuchtman, Noam', 'Dittmar, Jeremiah', 'Cantoni, Davide']","['Analysis of Education', 'Returns to Education', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Economic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: Pre-1913', 'Cultural Economics: Religion']","['I21', 'I26', 'J24', 'N33', 'Z12']",Religious Competition and Reallocation: The Political Economy of Secularization in the Protestant Reformation,0,0,0,0,0,2018,11,01

133,4,2018-11-01,"A key policy question is: how high an inflation rate should central banks target? This depends crucially on the costs of inflation. An important concern is that high inflation will lead to inefficient price dispersion. Workhorse New Keynesian models imply that this cost of inflation is very large. An increase in steady-state inflation from 0% to 10% yields a welfare loss that is an order of magnitude greater than the welfare loss from business cycle fluctuations in output in these models. We assess this prediction empirically using a new data set on price behavior during the Great Inflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States. If price dispersion increases rapidly with inflation, we should see the absolute size of price changes increasing with inflation: price changes should become larger as prices drift further from their optimal level at higher inflation rates. We find no evidence that the absolute size of price changes rose during the Great Inflation. This suggests that the standard New Keynesian analysis of the welfare costs of inflation is wrong and its implications for the optimal inflation rate need to be reassessed.

In contrast, marginal white defendants will have higher rates of misconduct than marginal black defendants if bail judges are racially biased, whether that bias is driven by racial animus, inaccurate racial stereotypes, or any other form of bias. To test the model, we use the release tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to identify the relevant race-specific misconduct rates. Estimates from Miami and Philadelphia show that bail judges are racially biased against black defendants, with substantially more racial bias among both inexperienced and part-time judges. We find suggestive evidence that this racial bias is driven by bail judges relying on inaccurate stereotypes that exaggerate the relative danger of releasing black defendants.","['Dobbie, Will', 'Yang, Crystal S.', 'Arnold, David']","['Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Litigation Process', 'Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law']","['J15', 'K41', 'K42']",Racial Bias in Bail Decisions,0,1,0,0,0,2018,11,01

Estimated elasticities are larger in the top 1% of the income distribution but are also positive and statistically significant for other income groups. Previous time series studies of tax returns data have found little evidence for income responses to taxes outside the top of the income distribution. The different results in this article arise because of additional efforts to account for dynamics, expectations, and especially the endogeneity of tax policy decisions. Marginal rate cuts lead to increases in real GDP and declines in unemployment. There is also evidence that the responses are to marginal tax rates rather than average tax rates. Counterfactual tax cuts targeting the top 1% alone are estimated to have short-run positive effects on economic activity and incomes outside of the top 1%, but to increase inequality in pretax incomes.

The account-level data and the properties of the payments rule out most previous explanations of excess sensitivity, including buffer stock models and rational inattention. How big are these ""mistakes?"" Using a sufficient statistics approach, I show that the welfare loss from excess sensitivity depends on the MPC and the relative payment size as a fraction of income.

For this purpose, we present the Global Preference Survey (GPS), an experimentally validated survey data set of time preference, risk preference, positive and negative reciprocity, altruism, and trust from 80,000 people in 76 countries. The data reveal substantial heterogeneity in preferences across countries, but even larger within-country heterogeneity. Across individuals, preferences vary with age, gender, and cognitive ability, yet these relationships appear partly country specific. At the country level, the data reveal correlations between preferences and biogeographic and cultural variables, such as agricultural suitability, language structure, and religion.

Many explanations for this energy efficiency gap have been put forward, but there has been surprisingly little field testing of whether the conventional wisdom is correct. This article reports on the results of an experimental evaluation of the nation's largest residential energy efficiency program--the Weatherization Assistance Program--conducted on a sample of approximately 30,000 households in Michigan. The findings suggest that the upfront investment costs are about twice the actual energy savings. Furthermore, the model-projected savings are more than three times the actual savings. Although this might be attributed to the ""rebound"" effect--when demand for energy end uses increases as a result of greater efficiency--the article fails to find evidence of significantly higher indoor temperatures at weatherized homes. Even when accounting for the broader societal benefits derived from emissions reductions, the costs still substantially outweigh the benefits; the average rate of return is approximately -7.8% annually.","['Greenstone, Michael', 'Fowlie, Meredith', 'Wolfram, Catherine']",['Energy: Government Policy'],['Q48'],Do Energy Efficiency Investments Deliver?

Agency purchases also influence prices in other asset markets, stimulate residential investment, and expand homeownership. We compare these effects to those of conventional monetary policy shocks, and we provide evidence on the interactions between housing credit and monetary policies.","['Mertens, Karel', 'Ravn, Morten O.', 'Fieldhouse, Andrew J.']","['Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy', 'Monetary Policy', 'Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages', 'Financial Institutions and Services: Government Policy and Regulation', 'Housing Supply and Markets']","['E44', 'E52', 'G21', 'G28', 'R31']",The Macroeconomic Effects of Government Asset Purchases: Evidence from Postwar U.S. Housing Credit Policy,0,0,0,0,0,2018,08,01

After narrowing from 1940 to the mid-1970s, the median black-white level earnings gap has since grown as large as it was in 1950. At the same time, the median black man's relative position in the earnings distribution has remained essentially constant since 1940, so that the improvement then worsening of median relative earnings have come mainly from the stretching and narrowing of the overall earnings distribution. Black men at higher percentiles have experienced significant advances in relative earnings since 1940, due mainly to strong positional gains among those with college educations. Large relative schooling gains by blacks at the median and below have been more than counteracted by rising return to skill in the labor market, which has increasingly penalized remaining racial differences in schooling at the bottom of the distribution.","['Bayer, Patrick', 'Charles, Kerwin Kofi']","['Returns to Education', 'Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Economic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-']","['I26', 'J15', 'J24', 'J31', 'N32']",Divergent Paths: A New Perspective on Earnings Differences between Black and White Men since 1940,0,0,0,0,0,2018,08,01

In response to an interest rate hike, nominal and real interest rates increase roughly one-for-one, several years out into the term structure, while the response of expected inflation is small.

To explain these facts, we build a model in which Fed announcements affect beliefs not only about monetary policy but also about other economic fundamentals.

For children growing up in low-income families, each year of childhood exposure to a one standard deviation (std. dev.) better county increases income in adulthood by 0.5%. There is substantial variation in counties' causal effects even within metro areas. Counties with less concentrated poverty, less income inequality, better schools, a larger share of two-parent families, and lower crime rates tend to produce better outcomes for children in poor families.

We distinguish the causal effects of neighborhoods from confounding factors by comparing the outcomes of siblings within families, studying moves triggered by displacement shocks, and exploiting sharp variation in predicted place effects across birth cohorts, genders, and quantiles to implement overidentification tests.

As well as formalizing this argument, our model demonstrates its limits, elucidating a robust theoretical force making democracy less stable in societies with high social mobility: when the median voter expects to move up (respectively down), she would prefer to give less voice to poorer (respectively richer) social groups. Our theoretical analysis shows that in the presence of social mobility, the political preferences of an individual depend on the potentially conflicting preferences of her ""future selves,"" and that the evolution of institutions is determined through the implicit interaction between occupants of the same social niche at different points in time.","['Acemoglu, Daron', 'Sonin, Konstantin', 'Egorov, Georgy']","['Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'Economic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Language; Social and Economic Stratification']","['D72', 'Z13']",Social Mobility and Stability of Democracy: Reevaluating De Tocqueville,0,0,0,0,0,2018,05,01

Specifically, we compare productivity changes for scientists who relied on frontier research from abroad, to changes for scientists who relied on frontier research from home. After 1914, scientists who relied on frontier research from abroad published fewer papers in top scientific journals, produced less Nobel Prize-nominated research, introduced fewer novel scientific words, and introduced fewer novel words that appeared in the text of subsequent patent grants. The productivity of scientists who relied on top 1% research declined twice as much as the productivity of scientists who relied on top 3% research.

We estimate the distribution of both pretax and posttax income, making it possible to provide a comprehensive view of how government redistribution affects inequality. Average pretax real national income per adult has increased 60% from 1980 to 2014, but we find that it has stagnated for the bottom 50% of the distribution at about $16,000 a year. The pretax income of the middle class--adults between the median and the 90th percentile--has grown 40% since 1980, faster than what tax and survey data suggest, due in particular to the rise of tax-exempt fringe benefits. Income has boomed at the top. The upsurge of top incomes was first a labor income phenomenon but has mostly been a capital income phenomenon since 2000.

We describe forces that affect initial play (formation of cooperation) and unraveling (breakdown of cooperation). First, contrary to the backward induction prediction, the parameters of the repeated game have a significant effect on initial cooperation. We identify how these parameters impact the value of cooperation--as captured by the size of the basin of attraction of always defect--to account for an important part of this effect. Second, despite these initial differences, the evolution of behavior is consistent with the unraveling logic of backward induction for all parameter combinations. Importantly, despite the seemingly contradictory results across studies, this article establishes a systematic pattern of behavior: subjects converge to use threshold strategies that conditionally cooperate until a threshold round; conditional on establishing cooperation, the first defection round moves earlier with experience. Simulation results generated from a learning model estimated at the subject level provide insights into the long-term dynamics and the forces that slow down the unraveling of cooperation.","['Frechette, Guillaume R.', 'Embrey, Matthew', 'Yuksel, Sevgi']","['Noncooperative Games', 'Stochastic and Dynamic Games; Evolutionary Games; Repeated Games']","['C72', 'C73']",Cooperation in the Finitely Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma,0,0,0,0,0,2018,02,01

We divide geographic characteristics into two groups, those primarily important for agriculture and those primarily important for trade, and confront a puzzle. In examining within-country variation in lights, among countries that developed early, agricultural variables incrementally explain over 6 times as much variation in lights as do trade variables, while among late developing countries the ratio is only about 1.5, even though the latter group is far more dependent on agriculture. Correspondingly, the marginal effects of agricultural variables as a group on lights are larger in absolute value, and those for trade smaller, for early developers than for late developers. We show that this apparent puzzle is explained by persistence and the differential timing of technological shocks in the two sets of countries. For early developers, structural transformation due to rising agricultural productivity began when transport costs were still high, so cities were localized in agricultural regions. When transport costs fell, these agglomerations persisted. In late-developing countries, transport costs fell before structural transformation. To exploit urban scale economies, manufacturing agglomerated in relatively few, often coastal, locations. Consistent with this explanation, countries that developed earlier are more spatially equal in their distribution of education and economic activity than late developers.","['Squires, Tim', 'Henderson, J.

Millions of times each year, judges make jail-or-release decisions that hinge on a prediction of what a defendant would do if released. The concreteness of the prediction task combined with the volume of data available makes this a promising machine-learning application. Yet comparing the algorithm to judges proves complicated. First, the available data are generated by prior judge decisions. We only observe crime outcomes for released defendants, not for those judges detained. This makes it hard to evaluate counterfactual decision rules based on algorithmic predictions. Second, judges may have a broader set of preferences than the variable the algorithm predicts; for instance, judges may care specifically about violent crimes or about racial inequities. We deal with these problems using different econometric strategies, such as quasi-random assignment of cases to judges. Even accounting for these concerns, our results suggest potentially large welfare gains: one policy simulation shows crime reductions up to 24.7% with no change in jailing rates, or jailing rate reductions up to 41.9% with no increase in crime rates. Moreover, all categories of crime, including violent crimes, show reductions; these gains can be achieved while simultaneously reducing racial disparities. These results suggest that while machine learning can be valuable, realizing this value requires integrating these tools into an economic framework: being clear about the link between predictions and decisions; specifying the scope of payoff functions; and constructing unbiased decision counterfactuals.","['Kleinberg, Jon', 'Ludwig, Jens', 'Leskovec, Jure', 'Mullainathan, Sendhil', 'Lakkaraju, Himabindu']","['Neural Networks and Related Topics', 'Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty', 'Neuroeconomics', 'Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law']","['C45', 'D81', 'D87', 'K42']",Human Decisions and Machine Predictions,0,1,0,0,0,2018,02,01

However, withholding information about criminal records could risk encouraging racial discrimination: employers may make assumptions about criminality based on the applicant's race. To investigate BTB's effects, we sent approximately 15,000 online job applications on behalf of fictitious young, male applicants to employers in New Jersey and New York City before and after the adoption of BTB policies. These applications varied whether the applicant had a distinctly black or distinctly white name and the felony conviction status of the applicant. We confirm that criminal records are a major barrier to employment: employers that asked about criminal records were 63% more likely to call applicants with no record. However, our results support the concern that BTB policies encourage racial discrimination: the black-white gap in callbacks grew dramatically at companies that removed the box after the policy went into effect. Before BTB, white applicants to employers with the box received 7% more callbacks than similar black applicants, but BTB increased this gap to 43%. We believe that the best interpretation of these results is that employers are relying on exaggerated impressions of real-world racial differences in felony conviction rates.","['Agan, Amanda', 'Starr, Sonja']","['Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Labor Discrimination', 'Labor Discrimination: Public Policy', 'Labor Law', 'Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law', 'Personnel Economics: Firm Employment Decisions; Promotions']","['J15', 'J71', 'J78', 'K31', 'K42', 'M51']","Ban the Box, Criminal Records, and Racial Discrimination: A Field Experiment",0,1,0,0,0,2018,02,01

We decompose the effect of changes in banks' cost of funds on aggregate borrowing into the product of banks' marginal propensity to lend (MPL) to borrowers and those borrowers' marginal propensity to borrow (MPB), aggregated over all borrowers in the economy. We apply our framework by estimating heterogeneous MPBs and MPLs in the U.S. credit card market. Using panel data on 8.5 million credit cards and 743 credit limit regression discontinuities, we find that the MPB is declining in credit score, falling from 59% for consumers with FICO scores below 660 to essentially zero for consumers with FICO scores above 740. We use a simple model of optimal credit limits to show that a bank's MPL depends on a small number of parameters that can be estimated using our credit limit discontinuities. For the lowest FICO score consumers, higher credit limits sharply reduce profits from lending, limiting banks' optimal MPL to these consumers. The negative correlation between MPB and MPL reduces the impact of changes in banks' cost of funds on aggregate household borrowing, and highlights the importance of frictions in bank-borrower interactions for understanding the pass-through of credit expansions.","['Mahoney, Neale', 'Agarwal, Sumit', 'Stroebel, Johannes', 'Chomsisengphet, Souphala']","['Household Saving; Personal Finance', 'Macroeconomics: Consumption; Saving; Wealth', 'Money Supply; Credit; Money Multipliers', 'Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages']","['D14', 'E21', 'E51', 'G21']",Do Banks Pass Through Credit Expansions to Consumers Who Want to Borrow?,0,0,0,0,0,2018,02,01

In this model, newly unemployed individuals search hard since consumption is below their reference point. Over time, though, they get used to lower income and thus reduce their search effort. In anticipation of a benefit cut, their search effort rises again, then declines once they get accustomed to the lower postcut benefit level. The model fits the typical pattern of exit from unemployment, even with no unobserved heterogeneity. To distinguish between this and other models, we use a unique reform in the unemployment insurance (UI) benefit path. In 2005, Hungary switched from a single-step UI system to a two-step system, with overall generosity unchanged. The system generated increased hazard rates in anticipation of, and especially following, benefit cuts in ways the standard model has a hard time explaining. We estimate a model with optimal consumption, endogenous search effort, and unobserved heterogeneity. The reference-dependent model fits the hazard rates substantially better than plausible versions of the standard model, including habit formation.

Economic models suggest that free-riding incentives and lower opportunity costs give the less competent a comparative advantage at entering political life. Moreover, if elites have more human capital, selecting on competence may lead to uneven representation. This article examines patterns of political selection among the universe of municipal politicians and national legislators in Sweden, using extraordinarily rich data on competence traits and social background for the entire population. We document four new facts that together characterize an ""inclusive meritocracy."" First, politicians are on average significantly smarter and better leaders than the population they represent. Second, this positive selection is present even when conditioning on family (and hence social) background, suggesting that individual competence is key for selection. Third, the representation of social background, whether measured by parental earnings or occupational social class, is remarkably even. Fourth, there is at best a weak trade-off in selection between competence and social representation, mainly due to strong positive selection of politicians of low (parental) socioeconomic status. A broad implication of these facts is that it is possible for democracy to generate competent and socially representative leadership.","['Folke, Olle', 'Rickne, Johanna', 'Persson, Torsten', 'Dal Bo, Ernesto', 'Finan, Frederico']","['Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'State and Local Government; Intergovernmental Relations: General', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Professional Labor Markets; Occupational Licensing', 'Public Sector Labor Markets', 'Economic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Language; Social and Economic Stratification']","['D72', 'H70', 'J24', 'J44', 'J45', 'Z13']",Who Becomes a Politician?,0,0,0,0,0,2017,11,01

This is true even when we control for lending opportunities by only comparing different branches of the same bank. Since deposits are the main source of liquid assets for households, the deposits channel can explain the observed strong relationship between the liquidity premium and the Fed funds rate. Since deposits are also a uniquely stable funding source for banks, the deposits channel impacts bank lending. When the Fed funds rate rises, banks that raise deposits in concentrated markets contract their lending by more than other banks.

We develop a tractable equilibrium model that features all of these trade-offs. The analytical expressions we derive for social welfare deliver a transparent understanding of how preference, technology, and market structure parameters influence the optimal degree of progressivity. A calibration for the U.S. economy indicates that endogenous skill investment, flexible labor supply, and the desire to finance government purchases play quantitatively similar roles in limiting optimal progressivity.

In the model, higher uncertainty about fundamentals discourages investment. Since agents learn from the actions of others, information flows slowly in times of low activity and uncertainty remains high, further discouraging investment. The economy displays uncertainty traps: self-reinforcing episodes of high uncertainty and low activity. Although the economy recovers quickly after small shocks, large temporary shocks may have long-lasting effects on the level of activity. The economy is subject to an information externality but uncertainty traps may remain in the efficient allocation. Embedding the mechanism in a standard business cycle framework, we find that endogenous uncertainty increases the persistence of large recessions and improves the performance of the model in accounting for the Great Recession.","['Schaal, Edouard', 'Taschereau-Dumouchel, Mathieu', 'Fajgelbaum, Pablo D.']","['Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty', 'Search; Learning; Information and Knowledge; Communication; Belief; Unawareness', 'Expectations; Speculations', 'Business Fluctuations; Cycles', 'Financial Crises']","['D81', 'D83', 'D84', 'E32', 'G01']",Uncertainty Traps,0,0,0,0,0,2017,11,01

Using a text analysis of the payoff formulas of the 55,000 products issued in Europe from 2002 to 2010, we measure product headline rates, complexity, and risk. Over this period, product headline rates depart from the prevailing interest rates as the latter decrease, complexity increases, and risky products become more common. In the cross section, the headline rate of a product is positively correlated with its level of complexity and risk. Higher headline rate, more complex, and riskier products appear more profitable to the banks distributing them.

The timing of this widening is, in turn, closely tied to the onset of a contraction in economic activity. Exploring the mechanism, we find that buoyant credit-market sentiment in year t - 2 also forecasts a change in the composition of external finance: net debt issuance falls in year t, while net equity issuance increases, consistent with the reversal in credit-market conditions leading to an inward shift in credit supply.

These decisions provide a clear test of the predictions of the standard economic model of insurance choice in the absence of choice frictions because plans were priced so that nearly every plan with a lower deductible was financially dominated by an otherwise identical plan with a high deductible. We document that the majority of employees chose dominated plans, which resulted in excess spending equivalent to 24% of chosen plan premiums. Low-income employees were significantly more likely to choose dominated plans, and most employees did not switch into more financially efficient plans in the subsequent year. We show that the choice of dominated plans cannot be rationalized by standard risk preference or any expectations about health risk. Testing alternative explanations with a series of hypothetical-choice experiments, we find that the popularity of dominated plans was not primarily driven by the size and complexity of the plan menu, nor informed preferences for avoiding high deductibles, but by employees' lack of understanding of health insurance. Our findings challenge the standard practice of inferring risk preferences from insurance choices and raise doubts about the welfare benefits of health reforms that expand consumer choice.","['Sydnor, Justin', 'Loewenstein, George', 'Bhargava, Saurabh']","['Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis', 'Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Insurance; Insurance Companies; Actuarial Studies', 'Analysis of Health Care Markets', 'Health Insurance, Public and Private']","['D12', 'D22', 'G22', 'I11', 'I13']",Choose to Lose: Health Plan Choices from a Menu with Dominated Options,0,0,0,0,0,2017,08,01

We leverage a natural experiment at a large self-insured firm that required all of its employees to switch from an insurance plan that provided free health care to a nonlinear, high-deductible plan. The switch caused a spending reduction between 11.8% and 13.8% of total firm-wide health spending. We decompose this spending reduction into the components of (i) consumer price shopping, (ii) quantity reductions, and (iii) quantity substitutions and find that spending reductions are entirely due to outright reductions in quantity. We find no evidence of consumers learning to price shop after two years in high-deductible coverage. Consumers reduce quantities across the spectrum of health care services, including potentially valuable care (e.g., preventive services) and potentially wasteful care (e.g., imaging services). To better understand these changes, we study how consumers respond to the complex structure of the high-deductible contract. Consumers respond heavily to spot prices at the time of care, reducing their spending by 42% when under the deductible, conditional on their true expected end-of-year price and their prior year end-of-year marginal price. There is no evidence of learning to respond to the true shadow price in the second year post-switch.","['Chandra, Amitabh', 'Brot-Goldberg, Zarek C.', 'Handel, Benjamin R.', 'Kolstad, Jonathan T.']","['Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis', 'Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Insurance; Insurance Companies; Actuarial Studies', 'Analysis of Health Care Markets', 'Health Insurance, Public and Private']","['D12', 'D22', 'G22', 'I11', 'I13']","What Does a Deductible Do?

In the stores studied, cashiers work with different managers on different days and their schedules are determined quasi-randomly. When minority cashiers, but not majority cashiers, are scheduled to work with managers who are biased (as determined by an implicit association test), they are absent more often, spend less time at work, scan items more slowly, and take more time between customers. This appears to be because biased managers interact less with minorities, leading minorities to exert less effort. Manager bias has consequences for the average performance of minority workers: while on average minority and majority workers perform equivalently, on days where managers are unbiased, minorities perform significantly better than do majority workers. The findings are consistent with statistical discrimination in hiring whereby because minorities underperform when assigned to biased managers, the firm sets a higher hiring standard for minorities to get similar average performance from minority and nonminority workers.","['Pallais, Amanda', 'Glover, Dylan', 'Pariente, William']","['Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Labor Discrimination', 'Retail and Wholesale Trade; e-Commerce', 'Personnel Economics: Firm Employment Decisions; Promotions']","['D22', 'J15', 'J71', 'L81', 'M51']",Discrimination as a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: Evidence from French Grocery Stores,1,0,0,0,0,2017,08,01

We investigate the impact of this transformation on the wage structure by following jobs that are moved outside the boundary of lead employers to contracting firms. We develop a new method for identifying outsourcing of food, cleaning, security, and logistics services in administrative data using the universe of social security records in Germany. We document a dramatic growth of domestic outsourcing in Germany since the early 1990s. Event-study analyses show that wages in outsourced jobs fall by approximately 10-15% relative to similar jobs that are not outsourced. We find evidence that the wage losses associated with outsourcing stem from a loss of firm-specific rents, suggesting that labor cost savings are an important reason firms choose to contract out these services. Finally, we tie the increase in outsourcing activity to broader changes in the German wage structure, in particular showing that outsourcing of cleaning, security, and logistics services alone accounts for around 9% of the increase in German wage inequality since the 1980s.","['Goldschmidt, Deborah', 'Schmieder, Johannes F.']","['Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Contracting Out; Joint Ventures; Technology Licensing', 'Food; Beverages; Cosmetics; Tobacco; Wine and Spirits', 'Personal, Professional, and Business Services', 'Personnel Economics: Labor Contracting Devices']","['J31', 'L24', 'L66', 'L84', 'M55']",The Rise of Domestic Outsourcing and the Evolution of the German Wage Structure,1,0,0,0,0,2017,08,01

We invented a new cutting technology that reduces waste of the primary raw material and gave the technology to a random subset of producers. Despite the clear net benefits for nearly all firms, after 15 months take-up remained puzzlingly low. We hypothesize that an important reason for the lack of adoption is a misalignment of incentives within firms: the key employees (cutters and printers) are typically paid piece rates, with no incentive to reduce waste, and the new technology slows them down, at least initially. Fearing reductions in their effective wage, employees resist adoption in various ways, including by misinforming owners about the value of the technology. To investigate this hypothesis, we implemented a second experiment among the firms that originally received the technology: we offered one cutter and one printer per firm a lump-sum payment, approximately a month's earnings, conditional on demonstrating competence in using the technology in the presence of the owner. This incentive payment, small from the point of view of the firm, had a significant positive effect on adoption. The results suggest that misalignment of incentives within firms is an important barrier to technology adoption in our setting.","['Chaudry, Shamyla', 'Verhoogen, Eric', 'Chaudhry, Azam', 'Atkin, David', 'Khandelwal, Amit K.']","['Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Compensation Packages; Payment Methods', 'Other Consumer Nondurables: Clothing, Textiles, Shoes, and Leather Goods; Household Goods; Sports Equipment', 'Industrialization; Manufacturing and Service Industries; Choice of Technology', 'Management of Technological Innovation and R&D']","['D22', 'J31', 'J33', 'L67', 'O14', 'O32']",Organizational Barriers to Technology Adoption: Evidence from Soccer Ball Producers in Pakistan,1,0,0,1,0,2017,08,01

Systematic use of fertilizer and hybrid seed is a pathway to increase productivity, but adoption of these technologies remains low. We investigate whether the quality of agricultural input can help explain low take-up. Testing modern products purchased in local markets, we find that fertilizer lacks 30% of nutrients, and hybrid maize seed is estimated to contain less than 50% of authentic seed. We document that such low quality results in low average returns. If authentic technologies replaced these low-quality products, however, average returns would be high. To rationalize the findings, we calibrate a learning model using data from our agricultural trials. Because agricultural yields are lousy, farmers' ability to learn about quality is limited and this can help explain the low quality equilibrium we observe, but also why the market has not fully collapsed.","['Svensson, Jakob', 'Bold, Tessa', 'Yanagizawa-Drott, David', 'Kaizzi, Kayuki C.']","['Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs', 'Information and Product Quality; Standardization and Compatibility', 'Economic Development: Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Other Primary Products', 'Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes', 'Land Ownership and Tenure; Land Reform; Land Use; Irrigation; Agriculture and Environment', 'Agricultural R&D; Agricultural Technology; Biofuels; Agricultural Extension Services', 'Agricultural Policy; Food Policy']","['I38', 'L15', 'O13', 'O33', 'Q15', 'Q16', 'Q18']","Lemon Technologies and Adoption: Measurement, Theory, and Evidence from Agricultural Markets in Uganda",1,0,0,1,0,2017,08,01
132,2,2017-05-01,"We initiate the study of naivety-based discrimination, the practice of conditioning offers on external information about consumers' naivete. Knowing that a consumer is naive increases a monopolistic or competitive firm's willingness to generate inefficiency to exploit the consumer's mistakes, so naivete-based discrimination is not Pareto-improving, can be Pareto-damaging, and often lowers total welfare when classical preference-based discrimination does not. Moreover, the effect on total welfare depends on a hitherto unemphasized market feature: the extent to which the exploitation of naive consumers distorts trade with different types of consumers. If the distortion is homogeneous across naive and sophisticated consumers, then under an arguably weak and empirically testable condition, naivete-based discrimination lowers total welfare. In contrast, if the distortion arises only for trades with sophisticated consumers, then perfect naivete-based discrimination maximizes social welfare, although imperfect discrimination often lowers welfare. If the distortion arises only for trades with naive consumers, then naivete-based discrimination has no effect on welfare. We identify applications for each of these cases. In our primary example, a credit market with present-biased borrowers, firms lend more than is socially optimal to increase the amount of interest naive borrowers unexpectedly pay, creating a homogeneous distortion. The condition for naivete-based discrimination to lower welfare is then weaker than prudence.","['Koszegi, Botond', 'Heidhues, Paul']","['Consumer Economics: Theory', 'Firm Behavior: Theory', 'Market Structure, Pricing, and Design: Oligopoly and Other Forms of Market Imperfection', 'Oligopoly and Other Imperfect Markets']","['D11', 'D21', 'D43', 'L13']",Naivete-Based Discrimination,1,0,1,0,0,2017,05,01

We use these data to document two novel empirical patterns. First, foreign affiliate and headquarter sales exhibit strong positive comovement: a 10% growth in the sales of the headquarter is associated with a 2% growth in the sales of the affiliate. Second, shocks to the source country account for a significant fraction of the variation in sales growth at the source-destination level. We propose a parsimonious quantitative model to interpret these findings and to evaluate the role of multinational firms for international business cycle transmission. For the typical country, the impact of foreign shocks transmitted by all foreign multinationals combined is non-negligible, accounting for about 10% of aggregate productivity shocks. On the other hand, since bilateral multinational production shares are small, interdependence between most individual country pairs is minimal. Our results do reveal substantial heterogeneity in the strength of this mechanism, with the most integrated countries significantly more affected by foreign shocks.","['Cravino, Javier', 'Levchenko, Andrei A.']","['Business Fluctuations; Cycles', 'Multinational Firms; International Business', 'International Business Cycles']","['E32', 'F23', 'F44']",Multinational Firms and International Business Cycle Transmission,0,0,0,0,0,2017,05,01

Test results from admissions lotteries in Boston suggest conventional VAM estimates are biased, a finding that motivates the development of a hierarchical model describing the joint distribution of school value-added, bias, and lottery compliance. We use this model to assess the substantive importance of bias in conventional VAM estimates and to construct hybrid value-added estimates that optimally combine ordinary least squares and lottery-based estimates of VAM parameters. The hybrid estimation strategy provides a general recipe for combining nonexperimental and quasi-experimental estimates. While still biased, hybrid school value-added estimates have lower mean squared error than conventional VAM estimates. Simulations calibrated to the Boston data show that, bias notwithstanding, policy decisions based on conventional VAMs that control for lagged achievement are likely to generate substantial achievement gains.

To do this we conduct a large-scale randomized control trial, covering over 21,000 households in 1,309 villages surveyed four times over a seven-year period, to evaluate a nationwide program in Bangladesh that transfers livestock assets and skills to the poorest women. At baseline, the poorest women mostly engage in low return and seasonal casual wage labor while wealthier women solely engage in livestock rearing. The program enables poor women to start engaging in livestock rearing, increasing their aggregate labor supply and earnings. This leads to asset accumulation (livestock, land, and business assets) and poverty reduction, both sustained after four and seven years. These gains do not crowd out the livestock businesses of noneligible households while the wages these receive for casual jobs increase as the poor reduce their labor supply.

Asset prices decline in all episodes, but the decline in financial crises is substantially larger than the decline in fundamentals so that expected returns going forward are large. However, drops in consumption and consumption volatility are fairly similar across financial crises and recessions and are largest during wars, so asset pricing models based on aggregate consumption have trouble matching these facts. Comparing crises to ""deep"" recessions strengthens these findings further. By disentangling financial crises from other bad macroeconomic times, the results suggest that financial crises are particularly important to understanding why risk premia vary.

These average effects mask considerable heterogeneity across groups: while younger natives experience larger wage effects, employment responses are particularly pronounced for older natives.

Using a new data set linking every car sold in the United States to the credit supplier involved in each transaction, we find that the collapse of the asset-backed commercial paper market reduced the financing capacity of such nonbank lenders as captive leasing companies in the automobile industry. As a result, car sales in counties that traditionally depended on nonbank lenders declined sharply. Although other lenders increased their supply of credit, the net aggregate effect of illiquidity on car sales is large and negative. We conclude that the decline in auto sales during the financial crisis was caused in part by a credit supply shock driven by the illiquidity of the most important providers of consumer finance in the auto loan market.

After an oil or gas discovery, the current account and saving rate decline for the first five years and then rise sharply during the ensuing years. Investment rises robustly soon after the news arrives, whereas GDP does not increase until after five years.

132,1,2017-02-01,"This article develops a model of optimal government debt maturity in which the government cannot issue state-contingent bonds and cannot commit to fiscal policy. If the government can perfectly commit, it fully insulates the economy against government spending shocks by purchasing short-term assets and issuing long-term debt. These positions are quantitatively very large relative to GDP and do not need to be actively managed by the government. Our main result is that these conclusions are not robust to the introduction of lack of commitment. Under lack of commitment, large and tilted debt positions are very expensive to finance ex ante since they exacerbate the problem of lack of commitment ex post. In contrast, a flat maturity structure minimizes the cost of lack of commitment, though it also limits insurance and increases the volatility of fiscal policy distortions. We show that the optimal time-consistent maturity structure is nearly flat because reducing average borrowing costs is quantitatively more important for welfare than reducing fiscal policy volatility. Thus, under lack of commitment, the government actively manages its debt positions and can approximate optimal policy by confining its debt instruments to consols.","['Nunes, Ricardo', 'Yared, Pierre', 'Debortoli, Davide']","['Fiscal Policy', 'Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency; Optimal Taxation', 'National Debt; Debt Management; Sovereign Debt']","['E62', 'H21', 'H63']",Optimal Time-Consistent Government Debt Maturity,0,0,0,0,0,2017,02,01

We study a program called Becoming a Man (BAM), developed by the nonprofit Youth Guidance, in two RCTs implemented in 2009-2010 and 2013-2015. In the two studies participation in the program reduced total arrests during the intervention period by 28-35%, reduced violent-crime arrests by 45-50%, improved school engagement, and in the first study where we have follow-up data, increased graduation rates by 12-19%. The third RCT tested a program with partially overlapping components carried out in the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC), which reduced readmission rates to the facility by 21%. These large behavioral responses combined with modest program costs imply benefit-cost ratios for these interventions from 5-to-1 up to 30-to-1 or more. Our data on mechanisms are not ideal, but we find no positive evidence that these effects are due to changes in emotional intelligence or social skills, self-control or ""grit,"" or a generic mentoring effect. We find suggestive support for the hypothesis that the programs work by helping youth slow down and reflect on whether their automatic thoughts and behaviors are well suited to the situation they are in, or whether the situation could be construed differently.","['Guryan, Jonathan', 'Heller, Sara B.', 'Pollack, Harold A.', 'Shah, Anuj K.', 'Ludwig, Jens', 'Mullainathan, Sendhil']","['Field Experiments', 'Analysis of Education', 'Education: Government Policy', 'Fertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth', 'Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law']","['C93', 'I21', 'I28', 'J13', 'K42']","Thinking, Fast and Slow?

The transfers differ from other programs in that they are explicitly unconditional, large, and concentrated in time. We randomized at both the village and household levels; furthermore, within the treatment group, we randomized recipient gender (wife versus husband), transfer timing (lump-sum transfer versus monthly installments), and transfer magnitude (US $404 PPP versus US $1,525 PPP). We find a strong consumption response to transfers, with an increase in household monthly consumption from $158 PPP to $193 PPP nine months after the transfer began. Transfer recipients experience large increases in psychological well-being. We find no overall effect on levels of the stress hormone cortisol, although there are differences across some subgroups. Monthly transfers are more likely than lump-sum transfers to improve food security, whereas lump-sum transfers are more likely to be spent on durables, suggesting that households face savings and credit constraints. Together, these results suggest that unconditional cash transfers have significant impacts on economic outcomes and psychological well-being.","['Haushofer, Johannes', 'Shapiro, Jeremy']","['National Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs', 'General Welfare; Well-Being', 'Measurement and Analysis of Poverty', 'Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs', 'Nonprofit Institutions; NGOs; Social Entrepreneurship', 'Economic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration', 'Formal and Informal Sectors; Shadow Economy; Institutional Arrangements']","['H53', 'I31', 'I32', 'I38', 'L31', 'O15', 'O17']",The Short-Term Impact of Unconditional Cash Transfers to the Poor: Experimental Evidence from Kenya,1,0,0,0,0,2016,11,01

Higher interest rates imply higher opportunity costs of holding money and hence a higher premium for the liquidity service benefits of assets that are close substitutes for money. Consistent with this theory, short-term interest rates in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have a strong positive relationship with the liquidity premium of Treasury bills and other near-money assets over periods going back to the 1920s. Once the opportunity cost of money is taken into account, Treasury security supply variables lose their explanatory power for the liquidity premium, except for transitory short-run effects. These findings indicate a high elasticity of substitution between money and near-money assets. As a consequence, a central bank that follows an interest rate operating target not only elastically accommodates and neutralizes shocks to money demand, but effectively also shocks to near-money asset supply and demand.","['Nagel, Stefan']","['Demand for Money', 'Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects', 'Monetary Policy', 'Central Banks and Their Policies', 'Asset Pricing; Trading Volume; Bond Interest Rates', 'Economic History: Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics; Industrial Structure; Growth; Fluctuations: U.S.; Canada: 1913-', 'Economic History: Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics; Industrial Structure; Growth; Fluctuations: Europe: 1913-']","['E41', 'E43', 'E52', 'E58', nan, 'N12', 'N14']",The Liquidity Premium of Near-Money Assets,0,0,0,0,0,2016,11,01

We have assembled a novel data set, where information on political institutions for northern central Italian cities between 1000 and 1300 is matched with detailed information on the earthquakes that occurred in the area and period of interest. Exploiting the panel structure of the data, we document that the occurrence of an earthquake retarded institutional transition from autocratic regimes to self-government (the commune) in cities where the political and the religious leaders were the same person (episcopal see cities), but not in cities where political and religious powers were distinct (non-episcopal see cities). Such differential effect holds for destructive seismic episodes and for events that were felt by the population but did not cause any material damage to persons or objects. Ancillary results show that seismic events provoked a positive and statistically significant differential effect on the construction and further ornamentation of religious buildings between episcopal and non-episcopal see cities. Our findings are consistent with the idea that earthquakes, interpreted in the Middle Ages as manifestation of the will and outrage of God, represented a shock to people's religious beliefs and, as a consequence, enhanced the ability of political-religious leaders to restore social order after a crisis relative to the emerging communal institutions. This interpretation is supported by historical evidence.","['Galbiati, Roberto', 'Drago, Francesco', 'Belloc, Marianna']","['Institutions: Design, Formation, Operations, and Impact', 'Structure, Scope, and Performance of Government', 'Economic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: Pre-1913', 'Economic History: Government, War, Law, International Relations, and Regulation: Europe: Pre-1913', 'Economic History: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Environment, and Extractive Industries: Europe: Pre-1913', 'Climate; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Global Warming', 'Cultural Economics: Religion']","['D02', 'H11', 'N33', 'N43', 'N53', 'Q54', 'Z12']","Earthquakes, Religion, and Transition to Self-Government in Italian Cities",0,0,0,0,0,2016,11,01

While it is difficult to unite individuals in a common endeavor, some people, who we call ""movers and shakers,"" seem able to do it. The article specifically examines moving and shaking of an investment project, whose return depends on its quality and the total capital invested in it. We analyze a model with two types of agents: managers and investors. Managers and investors initially form social connections. Managers then bid to buy control of the project, and the winning bidder puts effort into making investors aware of it. Finally, a subset of aware investors are given the chance to invest and they decide whether to do so after receiving private signals of the project's quality. We first show that connections are valuable since they make it easier for a manager to ""move and shake"" the project (i.e., obtain capital from investors). When we endogenize the network, we find that while managers are identical ex ante, a single manager emerges as most connected; he consequently earns a rent. In extensions, we move away from the assumption of ex ante identical managers to highlight forces that lead one manager or another to become a mover and shaker. Our theory sheds light on a range of topics, including entrepreneurship, venture capital, and anchor investments.","['Akerlof, Robert', 'Holden, Richard']","['Auctions', 'Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design', 'Investment; Capital; Intangible Capital; Capacity', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Economic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Language; Social and Economic Stratification']","['D44', 'D82', 'E22', 'J24', 'L26', 'Z13']",Movers and Shakers,1,0,1,0,0,2016,11,01

To parse the program's test score impacts relative to home care and competing preschools, we selection-correct test scores in each care environment using excluded interactions between experimental assignments and household characteristics.

We track descendants of participants in Georgia's Cherokee Land Lottery of 1832, in which nearly every adult white male in the state took part. Winners received close to the median level of wealth--a large financial windfall orthogonal to participants' underlying characteristics that might have also affected their children's human capital. Although winners had slightly more children than did nonwinners, they did not send them to school more. Sons of winners have no better adult outcomes (wealth, income, literacy) than the sons of nonwinners, and winners' grandchildren do not have higher literacy or school attendance than nonwinners' grandchildren. We can reject effects implied by the cross-sectional gradient of child outcomes by paternal wealth.

A decision maker (DM) faces an objective long-run probability distribution p over several variables (including the action taken by previous DMs). The DM is characterized by a subjective causal model, represented by a directed acyclic graph over the set of variable labels. The DM attempts to fit this model to p, resulting in a subjective belief that distorts p by factorizing it according to the graph via the standard Bayesian network formula. As a result of this belief distortion, the DM's evaluation of actions can vary with their long-run frequencies. Accordingly, I define a ""personal equilibrium"" notion of individual behavior. The framework enables simple graphical representations of causal-attribution errors (such as coarseness or reverse causation), and provides tools for checking rationality properties of the DM's behavior.

Instrumental variables (IV) estimation of the payoff to choosing one type of education compared to another is made particularly challenging by individuals choosing between several types of education. Not only does identification require one instrument per alternative, but it is also necessary to deal with the issue that individuals who choose the same education may have different next-best alternatives. We address these difficulties using rich administrative data for Norway's postsecondary education system. A centralized admission process creates credible instruments from discontinuities that effectively randomize applicants near unpredictable admission cutoffs into different institutions and fields of study. The admission process also provides information on preferred and next-best alternatives from strategy-proof measures of individuals' ranking of institutions and fields. The results from our IV approach may be summarized with three broad conclusions. First, different fields of study have substantially different labor market payoffs, even after accounting for institution and peer quality. Second, the effect on earnings from attending a more selective institution tends to be relatively small compared to payoffs to field of study. Third, the estimated payoffs to field of study are consistent with individuals choosing fields in which they have a comparative advantage. Comparing our estimates to those obtained from other approaches highlights the importance of using instruments to correct for selection bias and information on individuals' ranking of institutions and fields to measure their preferred and next-best alternatives.","['Mogstad, Magne', 'Leuven, Edwin', 'Kirkeboen, Lars J.']","['Higher Education; Research Institutions', 'Returns to Education', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials']","['I23', 'I26', 'J24', 'J31']","Field of Study, Earnings, and Self-Selection",0,0,0,0,0,2016,08,01

An example of this ""sorting by quality"" is the use of down payments to dissuade borrowers who are unlikely to repay. We study a model in which consumers have multidimensional types and a firm offers a single product of endogenous quality, as in Spence (1975). These two ingredients generate a novel sorting incentive in a firm's first-order condition for quality, which is a simple ratio. The denominator is marginal consumer surplus, a measure of market power. The numerator is the covariance, among marginal consumers, between marginal willingness to pay for quality and cost to the firm. We provide conditions under which this term is signed and contrast the sorting incentives of a profit-maximizer and a social planner. We then use this characterization to quantify the importance of sorting empirically in subprime auto lending, analytically sign its impact in a model of add-on pricing, and calibrate optimal competition policy in health insurance markets.","['Weyl, E.

Even when only capital is chosen under imperfect information, applying this methodology to data from the United States, China, and India reveals substantial losses in productivity and output due to the informational friction. Our estimates for these losses range from 7% to 10% for productivity and 10% to 14% for output in China and India, and are smaller, though still significant, in the United States.

A person's type is the probability of him choosing a contemplative action. To test the typology, results of 10 games are analyzed. Actions in each game were classified depending on whether their response time was more or less, respectively, than the median response time of all subjects who played the game. It is argued that fast actions are more instinctive and slow actions are more contemplative. A subject's contemplative index (CI) is defined as the proportion of games in which he chose a contemplative action. It is found that for 8 of the 10 games, the CI in the other 9 games is positively correlated with a player's choice of a contemplative action in that game (average Spearman correlation of 9%). The CI is used to shed light on the nature of choice in five additional games.","['Rubinstein, Ariel']","['Noncooperative Games', 'Design of Experiments: Laboratory, Individual', 'Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis']","['C72', 'C91', 'D12']",A Typology of Players: Between Instinctive and Contemplative,0,0,0,0,0,2016,05,01

Expansion of the railroad network may have affected all counties directly or indirectly--an econometric challenge that arises in many empirical settings. However, the total impact on each county is captured by changes in that county's ""market access,"" a reduced-form expression derived from general equilibrium trade theory. We measure counties' market access by constructing a network database of railroads and waterways and calculating lowest-cost county-to-county freight routes. We estimate that county agricultural land values increased substantially with increases in county market access, as the railroad network expanded from 1870 to 1890. Removing all railroads in 1890 is estimated to decrease the total value of U.S. agricultural land by 60%, with limited potential for mitigating these losses through feasible extensions to the canal network or improvements to country roads.","['Hornbeck, Richard', 'Donaldson, Dave']","['Empirical Studies of Trade', 'Railroads and Other Surface Transportation', 'Economic History: Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics; Industrial Structure; Growth; Fluctuations: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913', 'Economic History: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Environment, and Extractive Industries: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913', 'Economic History: Transport, Trade, Energy, Technology, and Other Services: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913', 'Size and Spatial Distributions of Regional Economic Activity', 'Transportation Economics: General']","['F14', 'L92', 'N11', 'N51', 'N71', 'R12', 'R40']",Railroads and American Economic Growth: A 'Market Access' Approach,1,0,0,0,0,2016,05,01

Our estimation sample is large, virtually free of attrition, and allows us to control for the factors conditional on which the prizes were randomly assigned. In adults, we find no evidence that wealth impacts mortality or health care utilization, with the possible exception of a small reduction in the consumption of mental health drugs. Our estimates allow us to rule out effects on 10-year mortality one sixth as large as the cross-sectional wealth-mortality gradient. In our intergenerational analyses, we find that wealth increases children's health care utilization in the years following the lottery and may also reduce obesity risk. The effects on most other child outcomes, including drug consumption, scholastic performance, and skills, can usually be bounded to a tight interval around zero. Overall, our findings suggest that in affluent countries with extensive social safety nets, causal effects of wealth are not a major source of the wealth-mortality gradients, nor of the observed relationships between child developmental outcomes and household income.","['Wallace, Bjorn', 'Cesarini, David', 'Lindqvist, Erik', 'Ostling, Robert']","['Household Saving; Personal Finance', 'Health Behavior', 'Fertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth', 'Sports; Gambling; Restaurants; Recreation; Tourism']","['D14', 'I12', 'J13', 'L83']","Wealth, Health, and Child Development: Evidence from Administrative Data on Swedish Lottery Players",1,0,0,0,0,2016,05,01

These premiums will contribute to the gender wage gap if women are less likely to work at high-paying firms or if women negotiate (or are offered) worse wage bargains with their employers than men. Using longitudinal data on the hourly wages of Portuguese workers matched with income statement information for firms, we show that the wages of both men and women contain firm-specific premiums that are strongly correlated with simple measures of the potential bargaining surplus at each firm. We then show how the impact of these firm-specific pay differentials on the gender wage gap can be decomposed into a combination of sorting and bargaining effects. We find that women are less likely to work at firms that pay higher premiums to either gender, with sorting effects being most important for low- and middle-skilled workers. We also find that women receive only 90% of the firm-specific pay premiums earned by men. Importantly, we find the same gender gap in the responses of wages to changes in potential surplus over time.

One of the areas in which the national accounts-household surveys debate is key is the measurement of developing world poverty. We propose a data-driven method to assess the relative quality of GDP per capita and survey means by comparing them to the evolution of satellite-recorded nighttime lights. Our main assumption, which is robust to a variety of specification checks, is that the measurement error in nighttime lights is unrelated to the measurement errors in either national accounts or survey means. We obtain estimates of weights on national accounts and survey means in an optimal proxy for true income; these weights are very large for national accounts and very modest for survey means. We conclusively reject the null hypothesis that the optimal weight on surveys is greater than the optimal weight on national accounts, and we generally fail to reject the null hypothesis that the optimal weight on surveys is zero. Additionally, we provide evidence that national accounts are good indicators of desirable outcomes for the poor (such as longer life expectancy, better education and access to safe water), and we show that surveys appear to perform worse in developing countries that are richer and that are growing faster. Therefore, we interpret our results as providing support for estimates of world poverty that are based on national accounts.","['Pinkovskiy, Maxim', 'Sala-i-Martin, Xavier']","['Data Collection and Data Estimation Methodology; Computer Programs: General', 'Measurement and Data on National Income and Product Accounts and Wealth; Environmental Accounts', 'Measurement and Analysis of Poverty', 'Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development', 'Economic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration']","['C80', 'E01', 'I32', 'O11', 'O15']","Lights, Camera . . .

We successfully test our capitalization method in three micro datasets where we can observe both income and wealth: the Survey of Consumer Finance, linked estate and income tax returns, and foundations' tax records. We find that wealth concentration was high in the beginning of the twentieth century, fell from 1929 to 1978, and has continuously increased since then. The top 0.1% wealth share has risen from 7% in 1978 to 22% in 2012, a level almost as high as in 1929. Top wealth-holders are younger today than in the 1960s and earn a higher fraction of the economy's labor income. The bottom 90% wealth share first increased up to the mid-1980s and then steadily declined. The increase in wealth inequality in recent decades is due to the upsurge of top incomes combined with an increase in saving rate inequality.

How many levels of government should there be? How should state borders be drawn? We develop a model of political agency in which voters differ in their ability to monitor rent-seeking politicians. We find that rent extraction is a decreasing and convex function of the share of informed voters, because voter information improves monitoring but also reduces the appeal of holding office. As a result, information heterogeneity pushes toward centralization to reduce rent extraction. Taste heterogeneity pulls instead toward decentralization to match local preferences. Our model thus implies that optimal borders should cluster by tastes but ensure diversity of information. We also find economies of scope in accountability that explain why multiplying government tiers harms efficiency. A single government in charge of many policies has better incentives than many special-purpose governments splitting its budget and responsibilities.

Entrants learn from incumbent firms, and the diffusion technology is such that learning depends not on the frontier technology, but on the entire distribution of productivity. By shifting the productivity distribution upward, selection causes technology diffusion, and in equilibrium this dynamic selection process leads to endogenous growth without scale effects. On the balanced growth path, the productivity distribution is a traveling wave with a lower bound that increases over time. The free entry condition implies trade liberalization must increase the dynamic selection rate to offset the profits from new export opportunities. Consequently, trade integration raises long-run growth. Dynamic selection is a new source of gains from trade not found when firms are homogeneous.

We report the first large-scale field experiment on these issues, where we experimentally allocated 482 property tax units in Punjab, Pakistan, into one of three performance pay schemes or a control. After two years, incentivized units had 9.4 log points higher revenue than controls, which translates to a 46% higher growth rate. The scheme that rewarded purely on revenue did best, increasing revenue by 12.9 log points (64% higher growth rate), with little penalty for customer satisfaction and assessment accuracy compared to the two other schemes that explicitly also rewarded these dimensions. The revenue gains accrue from a small number of properties becoming taxed at their true value, which is substantially more than they had been taxed at previously. The majority of properties in incentivized areas in fact pay no more taxes, but instead report higher bribes. The results are consistent with a collusive setting in which performance pay increases collectors' bargaining power over taxpayers, who have to either pay higher bribes to avoid being reassessed or pay substantially higher taxes if collusion breaks down.","['Khan, Adnan Q.', 'Olken, Benjamin A.', 'Khwaja, Asim I.']","['Bureaucracy; Administrative Processes in Public Organizations; Corruption', 'Tax Evasion and Avoidance', 'Compensation Packages; Payment Methods', 'Personnel Economics: Compensation and Compensation Methods and Their Effects', 'Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development']","['D73', 'H26', 'J33', 'M52', 'O23']",Tax Farming Redux: Experimental Evidence on Performance Pay for Tax Collectors,0,0,0,0,0,2016,02,01

To study the effect of these school finance reform-induced changes in public school spending on long-run adult outcomes, we link school spending and school finance reform data to detailed, nationally representative data on children born between 1955 and 1985 and followed through 2011. We use the timing of the passage of court-mandated reforms and their associated type of funding formula change as exogenous shifters of school spending, and we compare the adult outcomes of cohorts that were differentially exposed to school finance reforms, depending on place and year of birth. Event study and instrumental variable models reveal that a 10% increase in per pupil spending each year for all 12 years of public school leads to 0.31 more completed years of education, about 7% higher wages, and a 3.2 percentage point reduction in the annual incidence of adult poverty; effects are much more pronounced for children from low-income families.

(""Labor Supply of New York City Cabdrivers: One Day at a Time,"" Quarterly Journal of Economics, 112 [1997], 407-441), who find that the wage elasticity of daily hours of work for New York City taxi drivers is negative and conclude that their labor supply behavior is consistent with reference dependence. In contrast, my analysis of the complete record of all trips taken in NYC taxi cabs from 2009 to 2013 shows that drivers tend to respond positively to unanticipated as well as anticipated increases in earnings opportunities. Additionally, using a discrete choice stopping model, the probability of a shift ending is strongly positively related to hours worked but at best weakly related to income earned. I find substantial heterogeneity across drivers in their elasticities, but the estimated elasticities are generally positive and rarely substantially negative. I find that new drivers with smaller elasticities are more likely to exit the industry, whereas drivers who remain quickly learn to be better optimizers (have positive labor supply elasticities that grow with experience). These results are consistent with the neoclassical optimizing model of labor supply and suggest that consideration of gain-loss utility and income reference dependence is not an important factor in the daily labor supply decisions of taxi drivers.","['Farber, Henry S.']","['Time Allocation and Labor Supply', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Railroads and Other Surface Transportation', 'Transportation: Demand, Supply, and Congestion; Travel Time; Safety and Accidents; Transportation Noise']","['J22', 'J31', 'L92', 'R41']",Why You Can't Find a Taxi in the Rain and Other Labor Supply Lessons from Cab Drivers,1,0,0,0,0,2015,11,01

The median confidence interval on return on investment is over 100 percentage points wide. Detailed sales data show that relative to the per capita cost of the advertising, individual-level sales are very volatile; a coefficient of variation of 10 is common. Hence, informative advertising experiments can easily require more than 10 million person-weeks, making experiments costly and potentially infeasible for many firms. Despite these unfavorable economics, randomized control trials represent progress by injecting new, unbiased information into the market.

We study these questions in the context of Germany of the 1920s and 1930s. During the democratic period, when the Weimar government introduced progovernment political news, the growth of Nazi popularity slowed down in areas with access to radio. This effect was reversed during the campaign for the last competitive election as a result of the pro-Nazi radio broadcast following Hitler's appointment as chancellor. During the consolidation of dictatorship, radio propaganda helped the Nazis enroll new party members. After the Nazis established their rule, radio propaganda incited anti-Semitic acts and denunciations of Jews to authorities by ordinary citizens. The effect of anti-Semitic propaganda varied depending on the listeners' predispositions toward the message. Nazi radio was most effective in places where anti-Semitism was historically high and had a negative effect in places with historically low anti-Semitism.","['Petrova, Maria', 'Adena, Maja', 'Enikolopov, Ruben', 'Santarosa, Veronica', 'Zhuravskaya, Ekaterina']","['Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'Entertainment; Media', 'Economic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: 1913-', 'Economic History: Government, War, Law, International Relations, and Regulation: Europe: 1913-', 'Economic History: Transport, Trade, Energy, Technology, and Other Services: Europe: 1913-']","['D72', 'L82', 'N34', 'N44', 'N74']",Radio and the Rise of the Nazis in Prewar Germany,1,0,0,0,0,2015,11,01

We show that subscriber density is a strong predictor of city growth after the onset of French industrialization. Alternative measures of development such as soldier height, disposable income, and industrial activity confirm this pattern. Initial literacy levels, on the other hand, are associated with development in the cross-section, but they do not predict growth.

Member-country fiscal authorities lack commitment to repay their debt and choose fiscal policy independently. A common monetary authority chooses inflation for the union, also without commitment. We first describe the existence of a fiscal externality that arises in the presence of limited commitment and leads countries to overborrow; this externality rationalizes the imposition of debt ceilings in a monetary union. We then investigate the impact of the composition of debt in a monetary union, that is the fraction of high-debt versus low-debt members, on the occurrence of self-fulfilling debt crises. We demonstrate that a high-debt country may be less vulnerable to crises and have higher welfare when it belongs to a union with an intermediate mix of high- and low-debt members, than one where all other members are low-debt. This contrasts with the conventional wisdom that all countries should prefer a union with low-debt members, as such a union can credibly deliver low inflation.

130,4,2015-11-01,"The high-frequency trading arms race is a symptom of flawed market design. Instead of the continuous limit order book market design that is currently predominant, we argue that financial exchanges should use frequent batch auctions: uniform price double auctions conducted, for example, every tenth of a second. That is, time should be treated as discrete instead of continuous, and orders should be processed in a batch auction instead of serially. Our argument has three parts. First, we use millisecond-level direct-feed data from exchanges to document a series of stylized facts about how the continuous market works at high-frequency time horizons: (i) correlations completely break down; which (ii) leads to obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities; and (iii) competition has not affected the size or frequency of the arbitrage opportunities, it has only raised the bar for how fast one has to be to capture them. Second, we introduce a simple theory model which is motivated by and helps explain the empirical facts. The key insight is that obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities, like those observed in the data, are built into the market design--continuous-time serial-processing implies that even symmetrically observed public information creates arbitrage rents. These rents harm liquidity provision and induce a never-ending socially wasteful arms race for speed. Last, we show that frequent batch auctions directly address the flaws of the continuous limit order book. Discrete time reduces the value of tiny speed advantages, and the auction transforms competition on speed into competition on price. Consequently, frequent batch auctions eliminate the mechanical arbitrage rents, enhance liquidity for investors, and stop the high-frequency trading arms race.","['Budish, Eric', 'Shim, John', 'Cramton, Peter']","['Auctions', 'Market Design', 'Asset Pricing; Trading Volume; Bond Interest Rates']","['D44', 'D47', nan]",The High-Frequency Trading Arms Race: Frequent Batch Auctions as a Market Design Response,0,0,1,0,0,2015,11,01

Capital flows drive exchange rates by altering the balance sheets of financiers that bear the risks resulting from international imbalances in the demand for financial assets. Such alterations to their balance sheets cause financiers to change their required compensation for holding currency risk, thus affecting both the level and volatility of exchange rates. Our theory of exchange rate determination in imperfect financial markets not only helps rationalize the empirical disconnect between exchange rates and traditional macroeconomic fundamentals, it also has real consequences for output and risk sharing. Exchange rates are sensitive to imbalances in financial markets and seldom perform the shock absorption role that is central to traditional theoretical macroeconomic analysis.

To test this hypothesis, we first consider a natural experiment that introduced a performance leaderboard into computer-based high school courses. The result was a 24 percent performance decline. The decline appears to be driven by a desire to avoid the leaderboard; top performing students prior to the change, those most at risk of appearing on the leaderboard, had a 40 percent performance decline, while poor performing students improved slightly. We next consider a field experiment that offered students complimentary access to an online SAT preparatory course. Sign-up forms differed randomly across students only in whether they said the decision would be kept private from classmates. In nonhonors classes, sign-up was 11 percentage points lower when decisions were public rather than private. Honors class sign-up was unaffected. For students taking honors and nonhonors classes, the response depended on which peers they were with at the time of the offer, and thus to whom their decision would be revealed. When offered the course in a nonhonors class (where peer sign-up rates are low), they were 15 percentage points less likely to sign up if the decision was public. But when offered the course in an honors class (where peer sign-up rates are high), they were 8 percentage points more likely to sign up if the decision was public.

We present a model in which such banks cut dollar lending more than euro lending in response to a shock to their credit quality. Because these banks rely on wholesale dollar funding, while raising more of their euro funding through insured retail deposits, the shock leads to a greater withdrawal of dollar funding. Banks can borrow in euros and swap into dollars to make up for the dollar shortfall, but this may lead to violations of covered interest parity when there is limited capital to take the other side of the swap trade. In this case, synthetic dollar borrowing also becomes expensive, which causes cuts in dollar lending. We test the model in the context of the Eurozone sovereign crisis, which escalated in the second half of 2011 and resulted in U.S. money market funds sharply reducing their exposure to European banks in the year that followed. During this period dollar lending by Eurozone banks fell relative to their euro lending, and firms who were more reliant on Eurozone banks before the Eurozone crisis had a more difficult time borrowing.","['Scharfstein, David S.', 'Stein, Jeremy C.', 'Ivashina, Victoria']","['Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy', 'Multinational Firms; International Business', 'International Financial Markets', 'Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages', 'Pension Funds; Non-bank Financial Institutions; Financial Instruments; Institutional Investors', 'National Debt; Debt Management; Sovereign Debt']","['E44', 'F23', 'G15', 'G21', 'G23', 'H63']",Dollar Funding and the Lending Behavior of Global Banks,0,0,0,0,0,2015,08,01

Even if the mean of the ex ante distribution of consumer values is the same as that ex post, the shape of the distributions may differ, generating a difference between the surplus each product can extract. If, for example, consumers differ only in ex ante disease risk, then a monopolist would have more difficulty extracting surplus with a preventive than with a treatment because treatment consumers, having contracted the disease, no longer differ in disease risk. We show that the ratio of preventive to treatment producer surplus can be arbitrarily small, in particular when the distribution of consumer values has a Zipf shape and the disease is rare. The firm's bias toward treatments can be reversed, for example, if the source of private information is disease severity learned ex post. The difference between the producer surplus earned from the products can result in distorted R&D incentives; the deadweight loss from this distortion can be as large as the entire producer-surplus difference. Calibrations for HIV and heart attacks based on risk factors in the U.S. population suggest that the distribution of disease risk is sufficiently Zipf-similar to generate substantial differences between producer surplus from preventives and treatments. Empirically, we find that proxies for the Zipf-similarity of the disease-risk distribution are associated a significantly lower likelihood of vaccine development but not drug development.","['Snyder, Christopher M.', 'Kremer, Michael']","['Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis', 'Firm Behavior: Empirical Analysis', 'Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design', 'Analysis of Health Care Markets', 'Health Behavior', 'Health: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health', 'Chemicals; Rubber; Drugs; Biotechnology; Plastics']","['D12', 'D22', 'D82', 'I11', 'I12', 'I18', 'L65']",Preventives versus Treatments,1,0,0,0,0,2015,08,01

After two and four years of the program, we find no difference between test scores of lottery winners and losers on Telugu (native language), math, English, and science/social studies, suggesting that the large cross-sectional differences in test scores across public and private schools mostly reflect omitted variables. However, private schools also teach Hindi, which is not taught by the public schools, and lottery winners have much higher test scores in Hindi.

Strikingly, when authority is decentralized, the equilibrium predicts the opposite. The districts use their policy choice to discourage other districts from free-riding on them, thereby inefficiently minimizing informational spillovers. To address this failure, we introduce a dynamic form of federalism in which the central government harmonizes policy choices only after the districts have experimented. This progressive concentration of power induces a policy tournament that can increase the incentive to experiment and encourage policy convergence.

We exploit the kink in individuals' budgets set created by the famous ""donut hole,"" where insurance becomes discontinuously much less generous on the margin, to provide descriptive evidence of the drug purchase response to a price increase. We then specify and estimate a simple dynamic model of drug use that allows us to quantify the spending response along the entire nonlinear budget set. We use the model for counterfactual analysis of the increase in spending from ""filling"" the donut hole, as will be required by 2020 under the Affordable Care Act. In our baseline model, which considers spending decisions within a single year, we estimate that filling the donut hole will increase annual drug spending by about $150, or about 8 percent. About one-quarter of this spending increase reflects anticipatory behavior, coming from beneficiaries whose spending prior to the policy change would leave them short of reaching the donut hole. We also present descriptive evidence of cross-year substitution of spending by individuals who reach the kink, which motivates a simple extension to our baseline model that allows--in a highly stylized way--for individuals to engage in such cross-year substitution. Our estimates from this extension suggest that a large share of the $150 drug spending increase could be attributed to cross-year substitution, and the net increase could be as little as $45 a year.","['Finkelstein, Amy', 'Einav, Liran', 'Schrimpf, Paul']","['Economics of Contract: Theory', 'Insurance; Insurance Companies; Actuarial Studies', 'National Government Expenditures and Health', 'Health Insurance, Public and Private', 'Health: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health', 'Production, Pricing, and Market Structure; Size Distribution of Firms', 'Chemicals; Rubber; Drugs; Biotechnology; Plastics']","['D86', 'G22', 'H51', 'I13', 'I18', 'L11', 'L65']",The Response of Drug Expenditure to Nonlinear Contract Design: Evidence from Medicare Part D,1,0,0,0,0,2015,05,01

Compared to nonreferred applicants, referred applicants are more likely to be hired and more likely to accept offers, even though referrals and nonreferrals have similar skill characteristics. Referred workers tend to have similar productivity compared to nonreferred workers on most measures, but referred workers have lower accident rates in trucking and produce more patents in high-tech. Referred workers are substantially less likely to quit and earn slightly higher wages than nonreferred workers. In call centers and trucking, the two industries for which we can calculate worker-level profits, referred workers yield substantially higher profits per worker than nonreferred workers. These profit differences are driven by lower turnover and lower recruiting costs for referrals.","['Cowgill, Bo', 'Hoffman, Mitchell', 'Housman, Michael', 'Burks, Stephen V.']","['Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Safety; Job Satisfaction; Related Public Policy', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Labor Turnover; Vacancies; Layoffs', 'Firm Performance: Size, Diversification, and Scope', 'Personnel Economics: Firm Employment Decisions; Promotions', 'Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital']","['J24', 'J28', 'J31', 'J63', 'L25', 'M51', 'O34']",The Value of Hiring through Employee Referrals,1,0,0,1,0,2015,05,01

This article uses the incarceration tendency of randomly assigned judges as an instrumental variable to estimate causal effects of juvenile incarceration on high school completion and adult recidivism. Estimates based on over 35,000 juvenile offenders over a 10-year period from a large urban county in the United States suggest that juvenile incarceration results in substantially lower high school completion rates and higher adult incarceration rates, including for violent crimes. In an attempt to understand the large effects, we found that incarceration for this population could be very disruptive, greatly reducing the likelihood of ever returning to school and, for those who do return, significantly increasing the likelihood of being classified as having an emotional or behavioral disorder.","['Alzer, Anna', 'Doyle, Joseph J., Jr.']","['Analysis of Education', 'Fertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Litigation Process', 'Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law']","['I21', 'J13', 'J24', 'K41', 'K42']","Juvenile Incarceration, Human Capital, and Future Crime: Evidence from Randomly Assigned Judges",0,1,0,0,0,2015,05,01

We can therefore estimate the effect of education by comparing the treated to the untreated living in the same village, as well as those living in villages where no schools were set up. We find a significant positive treatment effect of education for the first generation of students, as well as their descendants: they have higher living standards, are less likely to be farmers, and are more likely to be politically active. We find large village-level externalities--descendants of the uneducated in villages with schools do better than those in control villages.

In this article we take a first stab at exploring these issues. Our main results imply that in the context of a canonical Ricardian model, optimal import tariffs should be uniform, whereas optimal export subsidies should be weakly decreasing with respect to comparative advantage, reflecting the fact that countries have more room to manipulate prices in their comparative-advantage sectors.

We find evidence that these patterns are consistent with a standard club good explanation for the emergence of costly religious practices: increased strictness of fasting screens out the less committed members, while the more committed respond with an increase in their relative levels of participation.

We show that the distribution of the share of income earned by the wife exhibits a sharp drop to the right of 1/2, where the wife's income exceeds the husband's income. We argue that this pattern is best explained by gender identity norms, which induce an aversion to a situation where the wife earns more than her husband. We present evidence that this aversion also impacts marriage formation, the wife's labor force participation, the wife's income conditional on working, marriage satisfaction, likelihood of divorce, and the division of home production. Within marriage markets, when a randomly chosen woman becomes more likely to earn more than a randomly chosen man, marriage rates decline. In couples where the wife's potential income is likely to exceed the husband's, the wife is less likely to be in the labor force and earns less than her potential if she does work. In couples where the wife earns more than the husband, the wife spends more time on household chores; moreover, those couples are less satisfied with their marriage and are more likely to divorce. These patterns hold both cross-sectionally and within couples over time.","['Pan, Jessica', 'Bertrand, Marianne', 'Kamenica, Emir']","['Household Production and Intrahousehold Allocation', 'Marriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse', 'Economics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Time Allocation and Labor Supply', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials']","['D13', 'J12', 'J16', 'J22', 'J31']",Gender Identity and Relative Income within Households,0,0,0,0,0,2015,05,01

The model keeps the architecture of the general-disequilibrium model of Barro and Grossman (1971) but takes a matching approach to the labor and product markets instead of a disequilibrium approach. On the product and labor markets, both price and tightness adjust to equalize supply and demand. Since there are two equilibrium variables but only one equilibrium condition on each market, a price mechanism is needed to select an equilibrium. We focus on two polar mechanisms: fixed prices and competitive prices. When prices are fixed, aggregate demand affects unemployment as follows. An increase in aggregate demand leads firms to find more customers. This reduces the idle time of their employees and thus increases their labor demand. This in turn reduces unemployment. We combine the predictions of the model and empirical measures of product market tightness, labor market tightness, output, and employment to assess the sources of labor market fluctuations in the United States. First, we find that product market tightness and labor market tightness fluctuate a lot, which implies that the fixed-price equilibrium describes the data better than the competitive-price equilibrium. Next, we find that labor market tightness and employment are positively correlated, which suggests that the labor market fluctuations are mostly due to labor demand shocks and not to labor supply or mismatch shocks. Last, we find that product market tightness and output are positively correlated, which suggests that the labor demand shocks mostly reflect aggregate demand shocks and not technology shocks.","['Michaillat, Pascal', 'Saez, Emmanuel']","['Macroeconomics: Production', 'Employment; Unemployment; Wages; Intergenerational Income Distribution; Aggregate Human Capital; Aggregate Labor Productivity', 'Business Fluctuations; Cycles', 'Time Allocation and Labor Supply', 'Labor Demand', 'Unemployment: Models, Duration, Incidence, and Job Search']","['E23', 'E24', 'E32', 'J22', 'J23', 'J64']","Aggregate Demand, Idle Time, and Unemployment",0,0,0,0,0,2015,05,01

We study the public interest rationale for entry taxes in a general equilibrium model with free entry and exit of firms in which firm dynamics are driven by reputation concerns. In our model firms can produce high-quality output by making a costly but efficient initial unobservable investment. If buyers never learn about this investment, an extreme ""lemons problem"" develops, no firm invests, and the market shuts down. Learning introduces reputation incentives such that a fraction of entrants do invest.

We develop a laboratory product market in which low-cost production creates a negative externality for third parties, but where alternative production with higher costs mitigates the externality. Our first study, conducted in Switzerland, reveals a persistent preference among many consumers and firms for avoiding negative social impact in the market, reflected both in the composition of product types and in a price premium for socially responsible products. Socially responsible behavior is generally robust to varying market characteristics, such as increased seller competition and limited consumer information, and it responds to prices in a manner consistent with a model in which positive social impact is a utility-enhancing feature of a consumer product. In a second study, we investigate whether market social responsibility varies across societies by comparing market behavior in Switzerland and China. While subjects in Switzerland and China do not differ in their degree of social concern in nonmarket contexts, we find that low-cost production that creates negative externalities is significantly more prevalent in markets in China.

Call center employees who volunteered to WFH were randomly assigned either to work from home or in the office for nine months.

Home workers also reported improved work satisfaction, and their attrition rate halved, but their promotion rate conditional on performance fell. Due to the success of the experiment, Ctrip rolled out the option to WFH to the whole firm and allowed the experimental employees to reselect between the home and office.

We exploit a unique feature of housing markets in the United Kingdom and Singapore, where residential property ownership takes the form of either leaseholds or freeholds. Leaseholds are temporary, prepaid, and tradable ownership contracts with maturities between 99 and 999 years, while freeholds are perpetual ownership contracts. The price difference between leaseholds and freeholds reflects the present value of perpetual rental income starting at leasehold expiration, and is thus informative about very long-run discount rates. We estimate the price discounts for varying leasehold maturities compared to freeholds and extremely long-run leaseholds via hedonic regressions using proprietary data sets of the universe of transactions in each country. Households discount very long-run cash flows at low rates, assigning high present value to cash flows hundreds of years in the future. For example, 100-year leaseholds are valued at more than 10% less than otherwise identical freeholds, implying discount rates below 2.6% for 100-year claims.","['Maggiori, Matteo', 'Stroebel, Johannes', 'Giglio, Stefano']","['Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis', 'Intertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving', 'Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand', 'Housing Supply and Markets']","['D12', 'D15', 'R21', 'R31']",Very Long-Run Discount Rates,0,0,0,0,0,2015,02,01

129,4,2014-11-01,"A body of literature suggests that ethnic heterogeneity limits economic growth. This article provides microeconometric evidence on the direct effect of ethnic divisions on productivity. In team production at a plant in Kenya, an upstream worker supplies and distributes flowers to two downstream workers, who assemble them into bunches. The plant uses an essentially random rotation process to assign workers to positions, leading to three types of teams: (i) ethnically homogeneous teams, and teams in which (ii) one or (iii) both downstream workers belong to a tribe in rivalry with the upstream worker's tribe. I find strong evidence that upstream workers undersupply non-coethnic downstream workers (vertical discrimination) and shift flowers from non-coethnic to coethnic downstream workers (horizontal discrimination), at the cost of lower own pay and total output. A period of ethnic conflict following Kenya's 2007 election led to a sharp increase in discrimination. In response, the plant began paying the two downstream workers for their combined output (team pay). This led to a modest output reduction in (i) and (iii) teams--as predicted by standard incentive models--but an increase in output in (ii) teams, and overall. Workers' behavior before conflict, during conflict, and under team pay is predicted by a model of taste-based discrimination. My findings suggest that interethnic rivalries lower allocative efficiency in the private sector, that the economic costs of ethnic diversity vary with the political environment, and that in high-cost environments firms are forced to adopt ""second best"" policies to limit discrimination distortions.","['Hjort, Jonas']","['Production; Cost; Capital; Capital, Total Factor, and Multifactor Productivity; Capacity', 'Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Labor Discrimination', 'Transactional Relationships; Contracts and Reputation; Networks', 'Personnel Economics: Labor Management', 'Industrialization; Manufacturing and Service Industries; Choice of Technology', 'Economic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration']","['D24', 'J15', 'J71', 'L14', 'M54', 'O14', 'O15']",Ethnic Divisions and Production in Firms,1,0,0,0,0,2014,11,01

Individuals who in 1991 worked in manufacturing industries that experienced high subsequent import growth garner lower cumulative earnings, face elevated risk of obtaining public disability benefits, and spend less time working for their initial employers, less time in their initial two-digit manufacturing industries, and more time working elsewhere in manufacturing and outside of manufacturing. Earnings losses are larger for individuals with low initial wages, low initial tenure, and low attachment to the labor force. Low-wage workers churn primarily among manufacturing sectors, where they are repeatedly exposed to subsequent trade shocks. High-wage workers are better able to move across employers with minimal earnings losses and are more likely to move out of manufacturing conditional on separation. These findings reveal that import shocks impose substantial labor adjustment costs that are highly unevenly distributed across workers according to their skill levels and conditions of employment in the pre-shock period.","['Hanson, Gordon H.', 'Autor, David H.', 'Dorn, David', 'Song, Jae']","['Empirical Studies of Trade', 'Trade and Labor Market Interactions', 'Time Allocation and Labor Supply', 'Safety; Job Satisfaction; Related Public Policy', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Labor Turnover; Vacancies; Layoffs', 'Industry Studies: Manufacturing: General']","['F14', 'F16', 'J22', 'J28', 'J31', 'J63', 'L60']",Trade Adjustment: Worker-Level Evidence,1,0,0,0,0,2014,11,01

Our context is Norway's disability insurance (DI) system. To overcome the challenge of correlated unobservables across generations, we take advantage of random assignment of judges to DI applicants whose cases are initially denied. Some appeal judges are systematically more lenient, which leads to random variation in the probability a parent will be allowed DI. Using this exogenous variation, we find strong evidence for a causal link across generations: when a parent is allowed DI at the appeal stage, their adult child's participation over the next five years increases by 6 percentage points. This effect grows over time, rising to 12 percentage points after 10 years. Although these findings are specific to our setting, they highlight that welfare reforms can have long-lasting effects on program participation, since any original effect on the current generation could be reinforced by changing the participation behavior of their children as well.

The agent builds (as economists do) a simplified model of the world which is sparse, considering only the variables of first-order importance. His stylized model and his resulting choices both derive from constrained optimization. Still, the sparse max remains tractable to compute. Moreover, the induced outcomes reflect basic psychological forces governing limited attention. The sparse max yields a behavioral version of basic chapters of the microeconomics textbook: consumer demand and competitive equilibrium. I obtain a behavioral version of Marshallian and Hicksian demand, Arrow-Debreu competitive equilibrium, the Slutsky matrix, the Edgeworth box, Roy's identity, and so on. The Slutsky matrix is no longer symmetric: nonsalient prices are associated with anomalously small demand elasticities. Because the consumer exhibits nominal illusion, in the Edgeworth box, the offer curve is a two-dimensional surface rather than a one-dimensional curve. As a result, different aggregate price levels correspond to materially distinct competitive equilibria, in a similar spirit to a Phillips curve. The Arrow-Debreu welfare theorems typically do not hold. This framework provides a way to assess which parts of basic microeconomics are robust, and which are not, to the assumption of perfect maximization.","['Gabaix, Xavier']","['Microeconomic Behavior: Underlying Principles', 'Consumer Economics: Theory', 'Exchange and Production Economies']","['D01', 'D11', 'D51']",A Sparsity-Based Model of Bounded Rationality,0,0,0,0,0,2014,11,01

We find that contribution decisions depend on the interaction of gender and the gender stereotype associated with the decision-making domain: conditional on measured ability, individuals are less willing to contribute ideas in areas that are stereotypically outside of their gender's domain. Importantly, these decisions are largely driven by self-assessments, rather than fear of discrimination. Individuals are less confident in gender-incongruent areas and are thus less willing to contribute their ideas. Because even very knowledgeable group members undercontribute in gender-incongruent categories, group performance suffers and, ex post, groups have difficulty recognizing who their most talented members are. Our results show that even in an environment where other group members show no bias, women in male-typed areas and men in female-typed areas may be less influential. An intervention that provides feedback about a woman's (man's) strength in a male-typed (female-typed) area does not significantly increase the probability that she contributes her ideas to the group.

First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child's income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4% in Charlotte but 12.9% in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stability. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on intergenerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms.","['Chetty, Raj', 'Kline, Patrick', 'Saez, Emmanuel', 'Hendren, Nathaniel']","['Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions', 'Intertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving', 'Education and Inequality', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Job, Occupational, and Intergenerational Mobility; Promotion', 'Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics', 'Economic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Language; Social and Economic Stratification']","['D31', 'D15', 'I24', 'J24', 'J62', 'R23', 'Z13']",Where Is the Land of Opportunity?

There is, for example, considerably less world trade than predicted by Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) models. Trade among rich countries is higher and trade between rich and poor countries lower than suggested by HOV and other supply-driven theories, and trade-to-GDP ratios are higher in rich countries. Our approach focuses on the relationship between characteristics of goods and services in production and characteristics of preferences. In particular, we find a strong and significant positive correlation of more than 45% between a good's skilled-labor intensity and its income elasticity, even when accounting for trade costs and cross-country price differences. Exploring the implications of this correlation for empirical trade puzzles, we find that it can reduce HOV's overprediction of the variance of the net factor content of trade relative to that in the data by about 60%. Since rich countries are relatively skilled-labor abundant, they are relatively specialized in consuming the same goods and services that they are specialized in producing, and so trade more with one another than with poor countries. We also find a positive sector-level correlation between income elasticity and a sector's tradability, which helps explain the higher trade-to-GDP ratios in high-income relative to low-income countries.","['Markusen, James R.', 'Fally, Thibault', 'Caron, Justin']","['Neoclassical Models of Trade', 'Trade and Labor Market Interactions', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity']","['F11', 'F16', 'J24']",International Trade Puzzles: A Solution Linking Production and Preferences,0,0,0,0,0,2014,08,01

Although boys and girls display similar levels of academic ability, boys choose substantially more prestigious academic tracks, where more prestigious tracks are more math- and science-intensive. Our experimental measure shows that boys are also substantially more competitive than girls. We find that competitiveness is strongly positively correlated with choosing more prestigious academic tracks even conditional on academic ability.

Subsidies for retirement accounts, which rely on individuals to take an action to raise savings, primarily induce individuals to shift assets from taxable accounts to retirement accounts. We estimate that each $1 of government expenditure on subsidies increases total saving by only 1 cent. In contrast, policies that raise retirement contributions if individuals take no action--such as automatic employer contributions to retirement accounts--increase wealth accumulation substantially. We estimate that approximately 15% of individuals are ""active savers"" who respond to tax subsidies primarily by shifting assets across accounts; 85% of individuals are ""passive savers"" who are unresponsive to subsidies but are instead heavily influenced by automatic contributions made on their behalf. Active savers tend to be wealthier and more financially sophisticated. We conclude that automatic contributions are more effective at increasing savings rates than subsidies for three reasons: (i) subsidies induce relatively few individuals to respond, (ii) they generate substantial crowd-out conditional on response, and (iii) they do not increase the savings of passive individuals, who are least prepared for retirement.","['Leth-Petersen, Soren', 'Olsen, Tore', 'Chetty, Raj', 'Friedman, John N.', 'Nielsen, Torben Helen']","['Household Saving; Personal Finance', 'Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions', 'Macroeconomics: Consumption; Saving; Wealth', 'Personal Income and Other Nonbusiness Taxes and Subsidies; includes inheritance and gift taxes', 'Retirement; Retirement Policies']","['D14', 'D31', 'E21', 'H24', 'J26']",Active vs. Passive Decisions and Crowd-Out in Retirement Savings Accounts: Evidence from Denmark,0,0,0,0,0,2014,08,01

Comparing federal and state regulator supervisory ratings within the same bank, we find that federal regulators are systematically tougher, downgrading supervisory ratings almost twice as frequently as do state supervisors. State regulators counteract these downgrades to some degree by upgrading more frequently. Under federal regulators, banks report worse asset quality, higher regulatory capital ratios, and lower return on assets. Leniency of state regulators relative to their federal counterparts is related to costly outcomes, such as higher failure rates and lower repayment rates of government assistance funds. The discrepancy in regulator behavior is related to different weights given by regulators to local economic conditions and, to some extent, differences in regulatory resources.

Early on, the growth of long-distance trade enriched a broad group of merchants who used their newfound economic muscle to push for constraints on the executive, that is, for the end of a de facto hereditary Doge in 1032 and the establishment of a parliament in 1172. The merchants also pushed for remarkably modern innovations in contracting institutions that facilitated long-distance trade, for example, the colleganza. However, starting in 1297, a small group of particularly wealthy merchants blocked political and economic competition: they made parliamentary participation hereditary and erected barriers to participation in the most lucrative aspects of long-distance trade. Over the next two centuries this led to a fundamental societal shift away from political openness, economic competition, and social mobility and toward political closure, extreme inequality, and social stratification. We document this oligarchization using a unique database on the names of 8,178 parliamentarians and their families' use of the colleganza in the periods immediately before and after 1297. We then link these families to 6,959 marriages during 1400-1599 to document the use of marriage alliances to monopolize the galley trade.

Young adults in Uganda's conflict-affected north were invited to form groups and submit grant proposals for vocational training and business start-up. Funding was randomly assigned among screened and eligible groups. Treatment groups received unsupervised grants of $382 per member. Grant recipients invest some in skills training but most in tools and materials. After four years, half practice a skilled trade. Relative to the control group, the program increases business assets by 57%, work hours by 17%, and earnings by 38%. Many also formalize their enterprises and hire labor.

Binding credit market constraints and incomplete insurance can limit investment in activities with high expected profits. We conducted several experiments in northern Ghana in which farmers were randomly assigned to receive cash grants, grants of or opportunities to purchase rainfall index insurance, or a combination of the two. Demand for index insurance is strong, and insurance leads to significantly larger agricultural investment and riskier production choices in agriculture. The binding constraint to farmer investment is uninsured risk: when provided with insurance against the primary catastrophic risk they face, farmers are able to find resources to increase expenditure on their farms. Demand for insurance in subsequent years is strongly increasing with the farmer's own receipt of insurance payouts, with the receipt of payouts by others in the farmer's social network and with recent poor rain in the village. Both investment patterns and the demand for index insurance are consistent with the presence of important basis risk associated with the index insurance, imperfect trust that promised payouts will be delivered and overweighting recent events.","['Osei, Robert', 'Osei-Akoto, Isaac', 'Karlan, Dean', 'Udry, Christopher']","['Insurance; Insurance Companies; Actuarial Studies', 'Economic Development: Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Other Primary Products', 'Economic Development: Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; Corporate Finance and Governance', 'Micro Analysis of Farm Firms, Farm Households, and Farm Input Markets', 'Agricultural Finance', 'Economic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Language; Social and Economic Stratification']","['G22', 'O13', 'O16', 'Q12', 'Q14', 'Z13']",Agricultural Decisions after Relaxing Credit and Risk Constraints,0,0,0,0,0,2014,05,01

First, in contrast to the prior literature, we demonstrate that the law of one price holds very well within currency unions for tens of thousands of goods sold by each of the retailers, implying good-level real exchange rates often equal to 1. Prices of these same goods exhibit large deviations from the law of one price outside of currency unions, even when the nominal exchange rate is pegged. This clarifies that the common currency per se, and not simply the lack of nominal volatility, is important in reducing cross-country price dispersion. Second, we derive a new decomposition that shows that good-level real exchange rates in our data predominantly reflect differences in prices at the time products are first introduced, as opposed to the component emerging from heterogeneous passthrough or from nominal rigidities during the life of the good. Further, these international relative prices measured at the time of introduction move together with the nominal exchange rate. This stands in sharp contrast to pricing behavior in models where all price rigidity for any given good is due simply to costly price adjustment for that good.","['Rigobon, Roberto', 'Neiman, Brent', 'Cavallo, Alberto']","['Foreign Exchange', 'International Monetary Arrangements and Institutions', 'Production, Pricing, and Market Structure; Size Distribution of Firms', 'Retail and Wholesale Trade; e-Commerce']","['F31', 'F33', 'L11', 'L81']","Currency Unions, Product Introductions, and the Real Exchange Rate",1,0,0,0,0,2014,05,01

This scheme, introduced in 1991, allows new immigrants with high earnings to be taxed at a preferential flat rate for a duration of three years. We obtain two main results. First, the scheme has doubled the number of highly paid foreigners in Denmark relative to slightly less paid--and therefore ineligible--foreigners. This translates into a very large elasticity of migration with respect to 1 minus the average tax rate on foreigners, between 1.5 and 2. Second, we find compelling evidence of a negative effect of the scheme-induced reduction in the average tax rate on pretax earnings of foreign migrants at the individual level.

Using as controls authorities that were proposed but never approved by Congress, we find that the TVA led to large gains in agricultural employment that were eventually reversed when the program's subsidies ended. Gains in manufacturing employment, by contrast, continued to intensify well after federal transfers had lapsed--a pattern consistent with the presence of agglomeration economies in manufacturing. Because manufacturing paid higher wages than agriculture, this shift raised aggregate income in the TVA region for an extended period of time. Economists have long cautioned that the local gains created by place-based policies may be offset by losses elsewhere. We develop a structured approach to assessing the TVA's aggregate consequences that is applicable to other place-based policies. In our model, the TVA affects the national economy both directly through infrastructure improvements and indirectly through agglomeration economies. The model's estimates suggest that the TVA's direct investments yielded a significant increase in national manufacturing productivity, with benefits exceeding the program's costs. However, the program's indirect effects appear to have been limited: agglomeration gains in the TVA region were offset by losses in the rest of the country. Spillovers in manufacturing appear to be the rare example of a localized market failure that cancels out in the aggregate.","['Moretti, Enrico', 'Kline, Patrick']","['National Government Expenditures and Related Policies: Infrastructures; Other Public Investment and Capital Stock', 'Regional and Urban History: U.S.; Canada: 1913-', 'Regional Economic Activity: Growth, Development, Environmental Issues, and Changes']","['H54', 'N92', 'R11']","Local Economic Development, Agglomeration Economies, and the Big Push: 100 Years of Evidence from the Tennessee Valley Authority",0,0,0,0,0,2014,02,01

In this article, I argue that greater volatility leads to an increase in aggregate price flexibility so that nominal stimulus mostly generates inflation rather than output growth. To do this, I construct price-setting models with ""volatility shocks"" and show these models match new facts in CPI micro data that standard price-setting models miss. I then show that these models imply that output responds less to nominal stimulus during times of high volatility. Furthermore, because volatility is countercyclical, this implies that nominal stimulus has smaller real effects during downturns. For example, the estimated output response to additional nominal stimulus in September 1995, a time of low volatility, is 55% larger than the response in October 2001, a time of high volatility.","['Vavra, Joseph']","['Macroeconomics: Production', 'Business Fluctuations; Cycles', 'Monetary Policy', 'Fiscal Policy']","['E23', 'E32', 'E52', 'E62']",Inflation Dynamics and Time-Varying Volatility: New Evidence and an Ss Interpretation,0,0,0,0,0,2014,02,01

The lower price of investment goods explains roughly half of the observed decline in the labor share, even when we allow for other mechanisms influencing factor shares, such as increasing profits, capital-augmenting technology growth, and the changing skill composition of the labor force.

I construct a new data set that combines information on banking relationships and employment at 2,000 nonfinancial firms during the 2008-9 crisis. The article first verifies empirically the importance of banking relationships, which imply a cost to borrowers who switch lenders. I then use the dispersion in lender health following the Lehman crisis as a source of exogenous variation in the availability of credit to borrowers. I find that credit matters. Firms that had precrisis relationships with less healthy lenders had a lower likelihood of obtaining a loan following the Lehman bankruptcy, paid a higher interest rate if they did borrow, and reduced employment by more compared to precrisis clients of healthier lenders. Consistent with frictions deriving from asymmetric information, the effects vary by firm type. Lender health has an economically and statistically significant effect on employment at small and medium firms, but the data cannot reject the hypothesis of no effect at the largest or most transparent firms. Abstracting from general equilibrium effects, I find that the withdrawal of credit accounts for between one-third and one-half of the employment decline at small and medium firms in the sample in the year following the Lehman bankruptcy.","['Chodorow-Reich, Gabriel']","['Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design', 'Financial Crises', 'Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages', 'Financing Policy; Financial Risk and Risk Management; Capital and Ownership Structure; Value of Firms; Goodwill', 'Labor Demand', 'Firm Performance: Size, Diversification, and Scope']","['D82', 'G01', 'G21', 'G32', 'J23', 'L25']",The Employment Effects of Credit Market Disruptions: Firm-Level Evidence from the 2008-9 Financial Crisis,1,0,0,0,0,2014,02,01

Instead of perfect competition and two industries, GRH assume Bertrand competition and a continuum of industries. GRH conclude that the equilibrium is unique if transport costs are low, that there is no trade for high transport costs, and that there is no equilibrium in pure strategies when transport costs are intermediate. In this note we reexamine the equilibrium analysis under different transport costs for a single industry (partial equilibrium) version of GRH's model. We confirm many of GRH's results, but also find that there are circumstances under which there are multiple equilibria, including equilibria in which trade patterns run counter to ""natural"" comparative advantage, and also find that there is a profitable deviation to the mixed-strategy equilibrium postulated by GRH for intermediate trading costs. We propose an alternative set of strategies for this case and establish that they constitute an equilibrium.","['Lyn, Gary', 'Rodriguez-Clare, Andres']",['Models of Trade with Imperfect Competition and Scale Economies; Fragmentation'],['F12'],External Economies and International Trade Redux: Comment,0,0,0,0,0,2013,11,01

The terms-of-trade hypothesis posits that countries use tariffs in part to improve their terms of trade and that trade agreements cause them to internalize the costs that such terms-of-trade shifts impose on other countries. This article investigates whether the most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffs set by World Trade Organization (WTO) members in the Uruguay Round are consistent with the terms-of-trade hypothesis. We present a model of multilateral trade negotiations featuring endogenous participation that leads the resulting tariff schedules to display terms-of-trade effects. Specifically, the model predicts that the level of the importer's tariff resulting from negotiations should be negatively related to the product of two terms: exporter concentration, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (sum of squared export shares), and the importer's market power, as measured by the inverse elasticity of export supply, on a product-by-product basis. We test this hypothesis using data on tariffs, trade, and production across more than 30 WTO countries and find strong support. We estimate that the internalization of terms of trade effects through WTO negotiations has lowered the average tariff of these countries by 22% to 27% compared to its noncooperative level.","['Mayda, Anna Maria', 'Ludema, Rodney D.']","['Trade Policy; International Trade Organizations', 'Empirical Studies of Trade', 'Economic Integration']","['F13', 'F14', 'F15']",Do Terms-of-Trade Effects Matter for Trade Agreements?

Workers in newly regulated plants experienced, in aggregate, more than $5.4 billion in forgone earnings for the years after the change in policy. Most of these costs are driven by nonemployment and lower earnings in future employment, highlighting the importance of longitudinal data for characterizing the costs and consequences of labor market adjustment.

Policy making was also affected, as incumbents responded to large protests in their district by voting more conservatively in Congress.

There are three main results. First, the status quo system was largely corrupted, with auditors systematically reporting plant emissions just below the standard, although true emissions were typically higher.

We find that when gasoline prices rise, consumers substitute to lower octane gasoline, to an extent that cannot be explained by income effects. Across a wide range of specifications, we consistently reject the null hypothesis that households treat ""gas money"" as fungible with other income.

In addressing this broad question, we focus on the role played by political norms--specifically, the extent to which leaders abuse office for personal gain and the extent to which citizens punish such transgressions. We show how qualitatively distinct political norms can coexist because of a dynamic complementarity, in which citizens' willingness to punish transgressions is raised when they expect such punishments to be used in the future. We seek to understand the emergence of accountability by analysing transitions between norms. To do so, we extend the analysis to include the possibility that, at certain times, a segment of voters are (behaviorally) intolerant of transgressions. Our mechanism highlights the role of leaders, offering an account of how their actions can instigate enduring change, within a fixed set of formal institutions, by disrupting prevailing political norms. We show how such changes do not depend on ""sun spots"" to trigger coordination, and are asymmetric in effect--a series of good leaders can (and eventually will) improve norms, whereas bad leaders cannot damage them.","['Francois, Patrick', 'Bidner, Chris']","['Institutions: Design, Formation, Operations, and Impact', 'Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'Economic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Language; Social and Economic Stratification']","['D02', 'D72', 'Z13']",The Emergence of Political Accountability,0,0,0,0,0,2013,08,01

I decompose traders' average portfolio risks into two components: the uninsurable variance, defined as portfolio risks that would obtain without belief disagreements, and the speculative variance, defined as portfolio risks that result from speculation. My main result shows that financial innovation always increases the speculative variance through two distinct channels: by generating new bets and by amplifying traders' existing bets. When disagreements are large, these effects are sufficiently strong that financial innovation increases average portfolio risks, decreases average portfolio comovements, and generates greater speculative trading volume relative to risk-sharing volume. Moreover, a profit-seeking market maker endogenously introduces speculative assets that increase average portfolio risks.","['Simsek, Alp']","['Portfolio Choice; Investment Decisions', 'Asset Pricing; Trading Volume; Bond Interest Rates']","['G11', nan]",Speculation and Risk Sharing with New Financial Assets,0,0,0,0,0,2013,08,01

On the basis of plausible assumptions, accounting for unrecorded assets turns the eurozone, officially the world's second largest net debtor, into a net creditor. It also reduces the U.S. net debt significantly.

We show that West German households who had social ties to East Germany in 1989 experienced a persistent rise in their personal incomes after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Moreover, the presence of these households significantly affects economic performance at the regional level: it increases the returns to entrepreneurial activity, the share of households who become entrepreneurs, and the likelihood that firms based within a given West German region invest in East Germany. As a result, West German regions that (for idiosyncratic reasons) have a high concentration of households with social ties to the East exhibit substantially higher growth in income per capita in the early 1990s. A one standard deviation rise in the share of households with social ties to East Germany in 1989 is associated with a 4.7 percentage point rise in income per capita over six years.

Different salaries were announced randomly across recruitment sites, and job offers were subsequently randomized.

This allows the first experimental estimates of (1) the role of financial incentives in attracting a larger and more qualified pool of applicants, (2) the elasticity of the labor supply facing the employer, and (3) the role of job attributes (distance, attractiveness of the municipal environment) in helping fill vacancies, as well as the role of wages in helping fill positions in less attractive municipalities. A theoretical model of job applications and acceptance guides the empirical inquiry. We find that higher wages attract more able applicants as measured by their IQ, personality, and proclivity toward public sector work--that is, we find no evidence of adverse selection effects on motivation; higher wage offers also increased acceptance rates, implying a labor supply elasticity of around 2 and some degree of monopsony power. Distance and worse municipal characteristics strongly decrease acceptance rates, but higher wages help bridge the recruitment gap in worse municipalities.","['Rossi, Martin A.', 'Finan, Frederico', 'Dal Bo, Ernesto']","['Public Administration; Public Sector Accounting and Audits', 'Time Allocation and Labor Supply', 'Labor Demand', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Public Sector Labor Markets', 'Economic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration', 'Formal and Informal Sectors; Shadow Economy; Institutional Arrangements']","['H83', 'J22', 'J23', 'J31', 'J45', 'O15', 'O17']",Strengthening State Capabilities: The Role of Financial Incentives in the Call to Public Service,0,0,0,0,0,2013,08,01

During marriage search, parents with multiple daughters reduce the reservation quality for an older daughter's groom, rushing her marriage to allow sufficient time to marry off her younger sisters. Relative to younger brothers, younger sisters increase a girl's marriage risk; relative to younger singleton sisters, younger twin sisters have the same effect. These effects intensify in marriage markets with lower sex ratios or greater parental involvement in marriage arrangements. In contrast, older sisters delay a girl's marriage. Because girls leave school when they marry and face limited earning opportunities when they reach adulthood, the number of sisters has well-being consequences over the life cycle. Younger sisters cause earlier school-leaving, lower literacy, a match to a husband with less education and a less skilled occupation, and (marginally) lower adult economic status.

We show that these models provide a good approximation to the wage structure and can explain nearly all of the dramatic rise in West German wage inequality. Our estimates suggest that the increasing dispersion of West German wages has arisen from a combination of rising heterogeneity between workers, rising dispersion in the wage premiums at different establishments, and increasing assortativeness in the assignment of workers to plants. In contrast, the idiosyncratic job-match component of wage variation is small and stable over time.

The results are robust when I control for local and firm-level shocks that could potentially drive the introduction of new airline routes, when I consider only new airline routes that are the outcome of a merger between two airlines or the opening of a new hub, and when I consider only indirect flights where either the last leg of the flight (involving the plant's home airport) or the first leg of the flight (involving headquarters' home airport) remains unchanged.

When and why do governments choose to consolidate power and monopolize violence? How fast do they try to consolidate power? When does this lead to costly fighting rather than to efforts to eliminate the opposition by buying it off? We study an infinite-horizon model in which the government in each period decides how much to offer the opposition and the rate at which it tries to consolidate its power. The opposition can accept the offer and thereby acquiesce to the government's efforts to consolidate, or it can fight in an attempt to disrupt those efforts. In equilibrium, the government always tries to monopolize violence when it has ""coercive power"" against the opposition where, roughly, coercive power is the ability to weaken the opposition by lowering its payoff to fighting. Whether the government consolidates peacefully or through costly fighting depends on the size of any ""contingent spoils,"" which are benefits that begin to accrue from an increase in economic activity resulting from the monopolization of violence and the higher level of security that comes with it. When contingent spoils are small, the government buys the opposition off and eliminates it as fast as is peacefully possible.

The price mechanism transmutes demand shifts into industry-wide reorganizations and generates external effects from technological shocks: productivity changes in some firms may induce ownership changes in others.

Notches create excess bunching on the low-tax side and missing mass on the high-tax side of a cutoff, and they are often associated with a region of strictly dominated choice that would have zero mass in a frictionless world. By combining excess bunching (observed response attenuated by frictions) with missing mass in the dominated region (frictions), it is possible to uncover the structural elasticity that would govern behavior in the absence of frictions and arguably capture long-run behavior. We apply our framework to tax notches in Pakistan using rich administrative data. While observed bunching is large and sharp, optimization frictions are also very large as the majority of taxpayers in dominated ranges are unresponsive to tax incentives. The combination of large observed bunching and large frictions implies that the frictionless behavioral response to notches is extremely large, but the underlying structural elasticity driving this response is nevertheless modest. This highlights the inefficiency of notches: by creating extremely strong price distortions, they induce large behavioral responses even when structural elasticities are small.","['Kleven, Henrik J.', 'Waseem, Mazhar']","['Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities; Redistributive Effects; Environmental Taxes and Subsidies', 'Personal Income and Other Nonbusiness Taxes and Subsidies; includes inheritance and gift taxes', 'Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents: Household', 'Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development', 'Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development']","['H23', 'H24', 'H31', 'O12', 'O23']",Using Notches to Uncover Optimization Frictions and Structural Elasticities: Theory and Evidence from Pakistan,0,0,0,0,0,2013,05,01

To interpret the data, we develop a simple model that identifies the flow of new vacancies and the job-filling rate for vacant positions. The fill rate moves counter to aggregate employment but rises steeply with employer growth rates in the cross-section. It falls with employer size, rises with worker turnover rates, and varies by a factor of four across major industry groups. We also develop evidence that the employer-level hiring technology exhibits mild increasing returns in vacancies, and that employers rely heavily on other instruments, in addition to vacancies, as they vary hires. Building from our evidence and a generalized matching function, we construct a new index of recruiting intensity (per vacancy). Recruiting intensity partly explains the recent breakdown in the standard matching function, delivers a better-fitting empirical Beveridge curve, and accounts for a large share of fluctuations in aggregate hires.

However, if prison time lowers recidivism risk and if parole boards can accurately estimate inmates' recidivism risk, then relative to a fixed-sentence regime, parole can provide allocative-efficiency benefits (costly prison space is allocated to the highest-risk offenders) and incentive benefits (prisoners know they must reduce their recidivism risk to gain an early release, so invest in their own rehabilitation). Exploiting quasi-experiments from the state of Georgia, I show that prison time reduces recidivism risk and that parole boards set prison time in an allocatively efficient manner. Prisoners respond to these incentives; after a reform that eliminated parole for certain offenders, they accumulated a greater number of disciplinary infractions, completed fewer prison rehabilitative programs, and recidivated at higher rates than inmates unaffected by the reform. I estimate that eliminating parole for all prisoners would increase the prison population by 10% while also increasing the crime rate through deleterious effects on recidivism.","['Kuziemko, Ilyana']","['State and Local Government: Other Expenditure Categories', 'Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law']","['H76', 'K42']",How Should Inmates Be Released from Prison?

Gender-targeted job ads are common, favor women as often as men, and are much less common in jobs requiring higher levels of skill. Employers' relative preferences for female versus male workers, on the other hand, are more strongly related to the preferred age, height, and beauty of the worker than to job skill levels. Almost two-thirds of the variation in advertised gender preferences occurs within firms, and one-third occurs within firm occupation cells. Overall, these patterns are not well explained by a firm-level animus model, by a glass-ceiling model, or by models in which broad occupational categories are consistently gendered across firms. Instead, the patterns suggest a model in which firms have idiosyncratic preferences for particular job-gender matches, which are overridden in skilled positions by factors such as thinner labor markets or a greater incentive to search broadly for the most qualified candidate.","['Kuhn, Peter', 'Shen, Kailing']","['Economics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Labor Contracts', 'Labor Discrimination', 'Economic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration', 'Socialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty']","['J16', 'J41', 'J71', 'O15', 'P36']",Gender Discrimination in Job Ads: Evidence from China,0,0,0,0,0,2013,02,01

Our model predicts that the decision maker is too prone to choose options with concentrated advantages relative to alternatives, but maximizes utility when the advantages and disadvantages of alternatives are equally concentrated. Applying our model to intertemporal choice, these results predict that a person exhibits present bias and time inconsistency when--such as in lifestyle choices and other widely invoked applications of hyperbolic discounting--the future effect of a current decision is distributed over many dates, and the effects of multiple decisions accumulate. But unlike in previous models, in our theory (1) present bias is lower when the costs of current misbehavior are less dispersed, helping explain why people respond more to monetary incentives than to health concerns in harmful consumption; and (2) time inconsistency is lower when a person commits to fewer decisions with accumulating effects in her ex ante choice. In addition, a person does not fully maximize welfare even when making decisions ex ante: (3) she commits to too much of an activity--for example, exercise or work--that is beneficial overall; and (4) makes ""future-biased"" commitments when--such as in preparing for a big event--the benefit of many periods' effort is concentrated in a single goal.","['Koszegi, Botond', 'Szeidl, Adam']","['Consumer Economics: Theory', 'Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis', 'Intertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving']","['D11', 'D12', 'D15']",A Model of Focusing in Economic Choice,0,0,0,0,0,2013,02,01

We find that adopting these management practices raised productivity by 17% in the first year through improved quality and efficiency and reduced inventory, and within three years led to the opening of more production plants. Why had the firms not adopted these profitable practices previously? Our results suggest that informational barriers were the primary factor explaining this lack of adoption.

Both parties can make specific investments at private cost, and there is a machine that either party can control. As in incomplete-contracting models, different governance structures (i.e., different allocations of control of the machine) create different incentives for the parties' investments. As in rational-expectations models, some parties may invest in acquiring information, which is then incorporated into the market-clearing price of the intermediate good by these parties' production decisions. The informativeness of the price mechanism affects the returns to specific investments and hence the optimal governance structure for individual firms; meanwhile, the governance choices by individual firms affect the informativeness of the price mechanism.

We use the theory to analyze the impact of international trade on organization and calibrate the model to the U.S. economy. Our results indicate that, as a result of a bilateral trade liberalization, firms that export will increase the number of layers of management. The new organization of the average exporter results in higher productivity, although the responses of productivity are heterogeneous across these firms.

We use a research design that exploits day-to-day variation in the composition of the jury pool to isolate quasi-random variation in the composition of the seated jury, finding evidence that (i) juries formed from all-white jury pools convict black defendants significantly (16 percentage points) more often than white defendants, and (ii) this gap in conviction rates is entirely eliminated when the jury pool includes at least one black member. The impact of jury race is much greater than what a simple correlation of the race of the seated jury and conviction rates would suggest.

127,2,2012-05-01,"This article characterizes optimal policy when a government uses indirect control to exert its authority. We develop a dynamic principal-agent model in which a principal (a government) delegates the prevention of a disturbance--such as riots, protests, terrorism, crime, or tax evasion--to an agent who has an advantage in accomplishing this task. Our setting is a standard repeated moral hazard model with two additional features. First, the principal is allowed to exert direct control by intervening with an endogenously determined intensity of force which is costly to both players. Second, the principal suffers from limited commitment. Using recursive methods, we derive a fully analytical characterization of the intensity, likelihood, and duration of intervention. The first main insight from our model is that repeated and costly equilibrium interventions are a feature of optimal policy. This is because they are the most efficient credible means for the principal of providing incentives for the agent. The second main insight is a detailed analysis of a fundamental trade-off between the intensity and duration of intervention which is driven by the principal's inability to commit. Finally, we derive sharp predictions regarding the impact of various factors on the optimal intensity, likelihood, and duration of intervention. We discuss these results in the context of some historical episodes.","['Padro i Miquel, Gerard', 'Yared, Pierre']","['Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design', 'Structure, Scope, and Performance of Government']","['D82', 'H11']",The Political Economy of Indirect Control,0,0,0,0,0,2012,05,01

On one hand, sovereign default models treat income fluctuations as an exogenous endowment process with ad hoc default costs. On the other hand, emerging markets business cycle models abstract from modeling default and treat default risk as part of an exogenous interest rate on working capital. We propose instead a general equilibrium model of both sovereign default and business cycles. In the model, some imported inputs require working capital financing, and default triggers an efficiency loss as these inputs are replaced by imperfect substitutes, because both firms and the government are excluded from credit markets. Default is an optimal decision of a benevolent planner for whom, even after internalizing the adverse effects of default on economic activity, financial autarky has a higher payoff than debt repayment. The model explains the main features of observed cyclical dynamics around defaults, countercyclical spreads, high debt ratios, and key long-run business cycle moments.","['Mendoza, Enrique G.', 'Yue, Vivian Z.']","['Business Fluctuations; Cycles', 'Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy', 'International Lending and Debt Problems']","['E32', 'E44', 'F34']",A General Equilibrium Model of Sovereign Default and Business Cycles,0,0,0,0,0,2012,05,01

The first fact means that fluctuations in spending on World Bank-financed projects are a significant source of fluctuations in overall government spending in these countries. The second fact means that fluctuations in World Bank-financed spending in a given year are largely determined by fluctuations in project approval decisions made in previous years, and so are unlikely to be correlated with shocks to output in the current year. I use World Bank project-level disbursement data to isolate the component of World Bank-financed government spending in a given year that is associated with past project approval decisions. I use this as an instrument for total government spending to estimate multipliers in a sample of 29 primarily low-income countries where variation in government spending from this source is large relative to the size of the economy. The resulting spending multipliers are small and reasonably precisely estimated to be in the vicinity of 0.5.","['Kraay, Aart']","['Fiscal Policy', 'Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development']","['E62', 'O23']",How Large Is the Government Spending Multiplier?

127,2,2012-05-01,"One goal of extending the duration of unemployment insurance (UI) in recessions is to increase UI coverage in the face of longer unemployment spells. Although it is a common concern that such extensions may themselves raise nonemployment durations, it is not known how recessions would affect the magnitude of this moral hazard. To obtain causal estimates of the differential effects of UI in booms and recessions, this article exploits the fact that in Germany, potential UI benefit duration is a function of exact age which is itself invariant over the business cycle. We implement a regression discontinuity design separately for 20 years and correlate our estimates with measures of the business cycle. We find that the nonemployment effects of a month of additional UI benefits are, at best, somewhat declining in recessions. Yet the UI exhaustion rate, and therefore the additional coverage provided by UI extensions, rises substantially during a downturn. The ratio of these two effects represents the nonemployment response of workers weighted by the probability of being affected by UI extensions. Hence, our results imply that the effective moral hazard effect of UI extensions is significantly lower in recessions than in booms. Using a model of job search with liquidity constraints, we also find that in the absence of market-wide effects, the net social benefits from UI extensions can be expressed either directly in terms of the exhaustion rate and the nonemployment effect of UI durations, or as a declining function of our measure of effective moral hazard.","['Schmieder, Johannes F.', 'Bender, Stefan', 'von Wachter, Till']","['Unemployment: Models, Duration, Incidence, and Job Search', 'Unemployment Insurance; Severance Pay; Plant Closings']","['J64', 'J65']",The Effects of Extended Unemployment Insurance over the Business Cycle: Evidence from Regression Discontinuity Estimates over 20 Years,0,0,0,0,0,2012,05,01

During a disaster an asset's fundamental value falls by a time-varying amount. This in turn generates time-varying risk premia and, thus, volatile asset prices and return predictability. Using the recent technique of linearity-generating processes, the model is tractable and all prices are exactly solved in closed form. In this article's framework, the following empirical regularities can be understood quantitatively: (i) equity premium puzzle; (ii) risk-free rate puzzle; (iii) excess volatility puzzle; (iv) predictability of aggregate stock market returns with price-dividend ratios; (v) often greater explanatory power of characteristics than covariances for asset returns; (vi) upward-sloping nominal yield curve; (vii) predictability of future bond excess returns and long-term rates via the slope of the yield curve; (viii) corporate bond spread puzzle; (ix) high price of deep out-of-the-money puts; and (x) high put prices being followed by high stock returns. The calibration passes a variance bound test, as normal-times market volatility is consistent with the wide dispersion of disaster outcomes in the historical record.

To study these phenomena, in this article I present a theory of petitions and public protests that explores their limits as mechanisms to aggregate information. The key assumption is that valuable information is dispersed among citizens. Through petitions and protests, citizens can signal their private information to the policy maker, who can then choose to use it or not. I first show that if citizens' individual signals are not sufficiently precise, information aggregation is impossible, no matter how large is the population of informed citizens, even if the conflict with the policy maker is small. I then characterize the conditions on conflict and the signal structure that guarantee information aggregation. When these conditions are satisfied, I show that full information aggregation is possible as the population grows to infinity. When they are not satisfied, I show that information aggregation may still be possible if social media are available.","['Battaglini, Marco']","['Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design', 'Search; Learning; Information and Knowledge; Communication; Belief; Unawareness', 'Economic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Language; Social and Economic Stratification']","['D72', 'D82', 'D83', 'Z13']",Public Protests and Policy Making,0,0,0,0,0,2017,02,01

Individuals who started working on or after 1993 face permanently a much higher earnings cap for payroll taxes, creating a large and permanent discontinuity in marginal payroll tax rates by date of entry in the labor force for upper earnings workers. Using full-population administrative social security data and a regression discontinuity design, we estimate the long-term labor supply effects and incidence of payroll tax rates on earnings. Standard theory predicts that in the long run, new regime workers should bear the entire burden of the payroll tax increase (relative to old regime workers). In contrast, we find that employers compensate new regime workers for the extra employer payroll taxes but not for the extra employee payroll taxes. We do not find any evidence of labor supply responses along the extensive or intensive margins around the discontinuity, suggesting low efficiency costs of payroll taxes. We discuss various possible explanations for those results.","['Tsakloglou, Panos', 'Matsaganis, Manos', 'Saez, Emmanuel']","['Personal Income and Other Nonbusiness Taxes and Subsidies; includes inheritance and gift taxes', 'Business Taxes and Subsidies including sales and value-added (VAT)', 'Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents: Household', 'Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents: Firm', 'Time Allocation and Labor Supply', 'Firm Performance: Size, Diversification, and Scope']","['H24', 'H25', 'H31', 'H32', 'J22', 'L25']",Earnings Determination and Taxes: Evidence from a Cohort-Based Payroll Tax Reform in Greece,1,0,0,0,0,2012,02,01

This heterogeneity in pricing-to-market is robust to different measures of performance, samples, and econometric specifications. It is consistent with models where the demand elasticity decreases with firm performance. Since aggregate exports are concentrated on high-productivity firms, precisely those that absorb more exchange rate movements in their markups, heterogeneous pricing-to-market may partly explain the weak impact of exchange rate movements on aggregate exports.","['Mayer, Thierry', 'Martin, Philippe', 'Berman, Nicolas']","['Empirical Studies of Trade', 'Foreign Exchange', 'Firm Performance: Size, Diversification, and Scope']","['F14', 'F31', 'L25']",How Do Different Exporters React to Exchange Rate Changes?,1,0,0,0,0,2012,02,01

First, across firms selling a given product, exporters that charge higher prices earn greater revenues in each destination, have bigger worldwide sales, and enter more markets. Second, firms that export more, enter more markets, and charge higher export prices import more expensive inputs. Third, across destinations within a firm-product, firms set higher prices in richer, larger, bilaterally more distant and overall less remote countries. Fourth, across destinations within a firm-product, firms earn bigger revenues in markets where they set higher prices. Fifth, across firms within a product, exporters with more destinations offer a wider range of export prices. Finally, firms that export more, enter more markets, and offer a wider range of export prices pay a wider range of input prices and source inputs from more origin countries. We propose that trade models should incorporate two features to rationalize these patterns in the data: more successful exporters use higher quality inputs to produce higher quality goods (stylized facts 1 and 2), and firms vary the quality of their products across destinations by using inputs of different quality levels (stylized facts 3, 4, 5, and 6).","['Zhang, Zhiwei', 'Manova, Kalina']","['Empirical Studies of Trade', 'International Linkages to Development; Role of International Organizations', 'Socialist Institutions and Their Transitions: International Trade, Finance, Investment, Relations, and Aid']","['F14', 'O19', 'P33']",Export Prices across Firms and Destinations,0,0,0,0,0,2012,02,01

There can be significant increases in profits and reductions in interest rates when credit markets are competitive.

We examine the extent of comparison friction in the market for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans in the United States. In a randomized field experiment, an intervention group received a letter with personalized cost information. That information was readily available for free and widely advertised. However, this additional step--providing the information rather than having consumers actively access it--had an impact. Plan switching was 28% in the intervention group, versus 17% in the comparison group, and the intervention caused an average decline in predicted consumer cost of about $100 a year among letter recipients--roughly 5% of the cost in the comparison group.

Second, it shows how in a simple economy where commercial banks are the only lenders, conventional monetary policy tools such as open-market operations can be used to regulate this externality, whereas in more advanced economies it may be helpful to supplement monetary policy with other measures.

We present a theoretical framework that distinguishes two types of motivation: individuals like to give, for example, due to altruism or warm glow, and individuals would rather not give but dislike saying no, for example, due to social pressure. We design a door-to-door fund-raiser in which some households are informed about the exact time of solicitation with a flyer on their doorknobs. Thus, they can seek or avoid the fund-raiser. We find that the flyer reduces the share of households opening the door by 9% to 25% and, if the flyer allows checking a Do Not Disturb box, reduces giving by 28% to 42%. The latter decrease is concentrated among donations smaller than $10. These findings suggest that social pressure is an important determinant of door-to-door giving. Combining data from this and a complementary field experiment, we structurally estimate the model. The estimated social pressure cost of saying no to a solicitor is $3.80 for an in-state charity and $1.40 for an out-of-state charity.

Seven years after random assignment, lottery winners had been arrested for fewer serious crimes and had spent fewer days incarcerated. The gain in school quality as measured by peer and teacher inputs was equivalent to moving from one of the lowest-ranked schools to one at the district average. The reduction in crime comes largely from years after enrollment in the preferred school is complete. The impacts are concentrated among high-risk youth, who commit about 50% less crime across several different outcome measures and scalings of crime by severity.

I consider models of electoral accountability that allow rulers a choice of whether to hold elections and citizens whether to rebel. When individuals observe diverse signals of government performance, coordination to pose a credible threat of protest if the ruler ""shirks"" is problematic. The convention of an electoral calendar and known rules can provide a public signal for coordinating rebellion if elections are suspended or blatantly rigged, while the elections themselves aggregate private observations of performance. Two threats to this solution to political moral hazard are considered. First, a ruling faction that controls the army may prefer to fight after losing an election, and ex post transfers may not be credible. A party system in which today's losers may win in the future can restore self-enforcing democracy, though at the cost of weaker electoral control. Second, subtle electoral fraud can undermine the threat of coordinated opposition that maintains elections. I show that when there are organizations in society that can observe and announce a signal of the extent of popular discontent, the incumbent may prefer to commit to fair elections over an ""accountable autocratic"" equilibrium in which public goods are provided but costly rebellions periodically occur.","['Fearon, James D.']","['Institutions: Design, Formation, Operations, and Impact', 'Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior']","['D02', 'D72']",Self-Enforcing Democracy,0,0,0,0,0,2011,11,01

Class size does not have a significant effect on earnings at age 27, but this effect is imprecisely estimated. Second, students who had a more experienced teacher in kindergarten have higher earnings. Third, an analysis of variance reveals significant classroom effects on earnings.

In the absence of search frictions, our model reduces to a standard Ricardian model of trade. We use this simple model to contrast the implications of changes in the integration of Walrasian markets, which allow traders from different islands to exchange their goods, and changes in the access to these Walrasian markets, which allow farmers to trade with traders from different islands. We find that intermediation always magnifies the gains from trade under the former type of integration, but leads to more nuanced welfare results under the latter, including the possibility of aggregate losses.","['Costinot, Arnaud', 'Antras, Pol']","['Neoclassical Models of Trade', 'Models of Trade with Imperfect Competition and Scale Economies; Fragmentation']","['F11', 'F12']",Intermediated Trade,0,0,0,0,0,2011,08,01

A simple theoretical model of wealth accumulation, growth, and inheritance can fully account for the observed U-shaped pattern and levels. Using this model, we find that under plausible assumptions the annual bequest flow might reach about 20-25% of national income by 2050. This corresponds to a capitalized bequest share in total wealth accumulation well above 100%. Our findings illustrate the fact that when the growth rate g is small, and when the rate of return to private wealth r is permanently and substantially larger than the growth rate (say, r = 4-5% versus g = 1-2%), which was the case in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century and is likely to happen again in the twenty-first century, then past wealth and inheritance are bound to play a key role for aggregate wealth accumulation and the structure of lifetime inequality.

We develop a model in which firms post job offers characterized by an hours requirement and workers pay search costs to find jobs. We present evidence supporting three predictions of this model by analyzing bunching at kinks using Danish tax records. First, larger kinks generate larger taxable income elasticities. Second, kinks that apply to a larger group of workers generate larger elasticities. Third, the distribution of job offers is tailored to match workers' aggregate tax preferences in equilibrium.

Payday loans are small, high interest rate loans that constitute the marginal source of credit for many high risk borrowers. I find no evidence that payday loans alleviate economic hardship. To the contrary, loan access leads to increased difficulty paying mortgage, rent, and utilities bills. The empirical design isolates variation in loan access that is uninfluenced by lenders' location decisions and state regulatory decisions, two factors that might otherwise correlate with economic hardship measures. Further analysis of differences in loan availability--over time and across income groups--rules out a number of alternative explanations for the estimated effects. Counter to the view that improving credit access facilitates important expenditures, the results suggest that for some low-income households the debt service burden imposed by borrowing inhibits their ability to pay important bills.","['Melzer, Brian T.']","['Household Saving; Personal Finance', 'Intertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving', 'Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages']","['D14', 'D15', 'G21']",The Real Costs of Credit Access: Evidence from the Payday Lending Market,0,0,0,0,0,2011,02,01

Our empirical analysis uses police reports of violent incidents on Sundays during the professional football season. Controlling for the pregame point spread and the size of the local viewing audience, we find that upset losses (defeats when the home team was predicted to win by four or more points) lead to a 10% increase in the rate of at-home violence by men against their wives and girlfriends. In contrast, losses when the game was expected to be close have small and insignificant effects. Upset wins (victories when the home team was predicted to lose) also have little impact on violence, consistent with asymmetry in the gain-loss utility function. The rise in violence after an upset loss is concentrated in a narrow time window near the end of the game and is larger for more important games.

The lack of good instruments prevents estimation of reliable multipliers for nondefense purchases; multipliers in the literature of two or more likely reflect reverse causation from GDP to nondefense purchases. Increases in average marginal income tax rates (measured by a newly constructed time series) have significantly negative effects on GDP. When interpreted as a tax multiplier, the magnitude is around 1.1.

We use this decrease in analyst coverage for stocks covered by both merging houses before the merger (the treatment sample) to measure the causal effect of competition on bias. We find that the treatment sample simultaneously experiences a decrease in analyst coverage and an increase in optimism bias the year after the merger relative to a control group of stocks, consistent with competition reducing bias. The implied economic effect from our natural experiment is significantly larger than estimates from OLS regressions that do not correct for the endogeneity of coverage.

A government consists of a subset of the individuals in the society. The competence level of the government in office determines collective utilities (e.g., by determining the amount and quality of public goods), and each individual derives additional utility from being part of the government (e.g., rents from holding office). We characterize the dynamic evolution of governments and determine the structure of stable governments, which arise and persist in equilibrium. In our model, perfect democracy, where current members of the government do not have veto power over changes in governments, always leads to the emergence of the most competent government. However, any deviation from perfect democracy, to any regime with incumbency veto power, destroys this result. There is always at least one other, less competent government that is also stable and can persist forever, and even the least competent government can persist forever in office. We also show that there is a nonmonotonic relationship between the degree of incumbency veto power and the quality of government. In contrast, in the presence of stochastic shocks or changes in the environment, a regime with less incumbency veto power has greater flexibility and greater probability that high-competence governments will come to power. This result suggests that a particular advantage of ""democratic regimes"" (with a limited number of veto players) may be their greater adaptability to changes rather than their performance under given conditions. Finally, we show that ""royalty-like"" dictatorships may be more successful than ""junta-like"" dictatorships because in these regimes veto players are less afraid of change.","['Acemoglu, Daron', 'Sonin, Konstantin', 'Egorov, Georgy']","['Institutions: Design, Formation, Operations, and Impact', 'Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'Structure, Scope, and Performance of Government']","['D02', 'D72', 'H11']",Political Selection and Persistence of Bad Governments,0,0,0,0,0,2010,11,01

The celebrated Gale-Shapley student-optimal stable mechanism (SOSM) has recently replaced two deficient student assignment mechanisms that were in use in New York City and Boston. We provide theoretical evidence that the SOSM outcome may produce large welfare losses. Then we propose an efficiency-adjusted deferred acceptance mechanism (EADAM) that allows a student to consent to waive a certain priority that has no effect on his or her assignment. Under EADAM, consenting students cause themselves no harm, but may help many others benefit as a consequence. We show that EADAM can recover any welfare losses due to SOSM while also preserving immunity against strategic behavior in a particular way. It is also possible to use EADAM to eliminate welfare losses due to randomly breaking ties in student priorities.","['Kesten, Onur']","['State and Local Government: Health; Education; Welfare; Public Pensions', 'Analysis of Education', 'Education: Government Policy']","['H75', 'I21', 'I28']",School Choice with Consent,0,0,0,0,0,2010,08,01

We then show how this welfare loss can be estimated empirically using identifying variation in the price of insurance. Such variation, together with quantity data, allows us to estimate the demand for insurance. The same variation, together with cost data, allows us to estimate how insurers' costs vary as market participants endogenously respond to price. The slope of this estimated cost curve provides a direct test for both the existence and the nature of selection, and the combination of demand and cost curves can be used to estimate welfare. We illustrate our approach by applying it to data on employer-provided health insurance from one specific company.

Without a fence, farmers risked uncompensated damage by others' livestock. From 1880 to 1900, the introduction and near-universal adoption of barbed wire greatly reduced the cost of fences, relative to the predominant wooden fences, especially in counties with the least woodland. Over that period, counties with the least woodland experienced substantial relative increases in settlement, land improvement, land values, and the productivity and production share of crops most in need of protection. This increase in agricultural development appears partly to reflect farmers' increased ability to protect their land from encroachment. States' inability to protect this full bundle of property rights on the frontier, beyond providing formal land titles, might have otherwise restricted agricultural development.","['Hornbeck, Richard']","['Economic History: Government, War, Law, International Relations, and Regulation: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913', 'Economic History: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Environment, and Extractive Industries: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913', 'Capitalist Systems: Property Rights', 'Land Ownership and Tenure; Land Reform; Land Use; Irrigation; Agriculture and Environment']","['N41', 'N51', 'P14', 'Q15']",Barbed Wire: Property Rights and Agricultural Development,0,0,0,0,0,2010,05,01

Both properties can be implemented with a simple nonlinear tax on bequests, levied separately from the income tax. These results apply to other intergenerational transfers, such as educational investments, and are robust to endogenous fertility choices.

125,2,2010-05-01,"A key policy question is whether the benefits of additional medical expenditures exceed their costs. We propose a new approach for estimating marginal returns to medical spending based on variation in medical inputs generated by diagnostic thresholds. Specifically, we combine regression discontinuity estimates that compare health outcomes and medical treatment provision for newborns on either side of the very low birth weight threshold at 1,500 grams. First, using data on the census of U.S. births in available years from 1983 to 2002, we find that newborns with birth weights just below 1,500 grams have lower one-year mortality rates than do newborns with birth weights just above this cutoff, even though mortality risk tends to decrease with birth weight. One-year mortality falls by approximately one percentage point as birth weight crosses 1,500 grams from above, which is large relative to mean infant mortality of 5.5% just above 1,500 grams. Second, using hospital discharge records for births in five states in available years from 1991 to 2006, we find that newborns with birth weights just below 1,500 grams have discontinuously higher charges and frequencies of specific medical inputs. Hospital costs increase by approximately $4,000 as birth weight crosses 1,500 grams from above, relative to mean hospital costs of $40,000 just above 1,500 grams. Under an assumption that observed medical spending fully captures the impact of the ""very low birth weight"" designation on mortality, our estimates suggest that the cost of saving a statistical life of a newborn with birth weight near 1,500 grams is on the order of $550,000 in 2006 dollars.","['Doyle, Joseph J., Jr.', 'Almond, Douglas', 'Williams, Heidi', 'Kowalski, Amanda E.']","['Analysis of Health Care Markets', 'Health Behavior', 'Health: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health', 'Fertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth']","['I11', 'I12', 'I18', 'J13']",Estimating Marginal Returns to Medical Care: Evidence from At-Risk Newborns,0,0,0,0,0,2010,05,01

These protocols give preeminence to different aspects of the actual decision-making process and capture the observed heterogeneity in formal procedures across central banks. The models are estimated by maximum likelihood using interest rate decisions by the committees of five central banks, namely the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Swedish Riksbank, and the U.S. Federal Reserve. For all central banks, results indicate that the consensus model fits actual policy decisions better than the alternative models.

Conditional on being securitized, the portfolio with greater ease of securitization defaults by around 10%-25% more than a similar risk profile group with a lesser ease of securitization. We conduct additional analyses to rule out differential selection by market participants around the threshold and lenders employing an optimal screening cutoff unrelated to securitization as alternative explanations.

Showing fewer example loans, not suggesting a particular use for the loan, or including a photo of an attractive woman increases loan demand by about as much as a 25% reduction in the interest rate.

In this paper, we estimate the value of school facility investments using housing markets: standard models of local public goods imply that school districts should spend up to the point where marginal increases would have zero effect on local housing prices. Our research design isolates exogenous variation in investments by comparing school districts where referenda on bond issues targeted to fund capital expenditures passed and failed by narrow margins. We extend this traditional regression discontinuity approach to identify the dynamic treatment effects of bond authorization on local housing prices, student achievement, and district composition. Our results indicate that California school districts underinvest in school facilities: passing a referendum causes immediate, sizable increases in home prices, implying a willingness to pay on the part of marginal homebuyers of $1.50 or more for each $1 of capital spending.

In this paper, I develop falsification tests for three widely used VAM specifications, based on the idea that future teachers cannot influence students' past achievement. In data from North Carolina, each of the VAMs' exclusion restrictions is dramatically violated. In particular, these models indicate large ""effects"" of fifth grade teachers on fourth grade test score gains. I also find that conventional measures of individual teachers' value added fade out very quickly and are at best weakly related to long-run effects. I discuss implications for the use of VAMs as personnel tools.","['Rothstein, Jesse']","['State and Local Government: Health; Education; Welfare; Public Pensions', 'Analysis of Education', 'Public Sector Labor Markets']","['H75', 'I21', 'J45']","Teacher Quality in Educational Production: Tracking, Decay, and Student Achievement",0,0,0,0,0,2010,02,01

We measure sectoral labor productivity across countries using a model of the structural transformation. Productivity differences across countries are large in agriculture and services and smaller in manufacturing. Over time, productivity gaps have been substantially reduced in agriculture and industry but not nearly as much in services. These sectoral productivity patterns generate implications in the model that are broadly consistent with the cross-country data. We find that productivity catch-up in industry explains about 50% of the gains in aggregate productivity across countries, whereas low productivity in services and the lack of catch-up explain all the experiences of slowdown, stagnation, and decline observed across countries.","['Restuccia, Diego', 'Duarte, Margarida']","['Macroeconomics: Production', 'Employment; Unemployment; Wages; Intergenerational Income Distribution; Aggregate Human Capital; Aggregate Labor Productivity', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Industrial Organization and Macroeconomics: Industrial Structure and Structural Change; Industrial Price Indices', 'Empirical Studies of Economic Growth; Aggregate Productivity; Cross-Country Output Convergence']","['E23', 'E24', 'J24', 'L16', 'O47']",The Role of the Structural Transformation in Aggregate Productivity,1,0,0,0,0,2010,02,01

Annual earnings inequality is U-shaped, decreasing sharply up to 1953 and increasing steadily afterward. Short-term earnings mobility measures are stable over the full period except for a temporary surge during World War II. Virtually all of the increase in the variance in annual (log) earnings since 1970 is due to increase in the variance of permanent earnings (as opposed to transitory earnings). Mobility at the top of the earnings distribution is stable and has not mitigated the dramatic increase in annual earnings concentration since the 1970s. Long-term mobility among all workers has increased since the 1950s but has slightly declined among men. The decrease in the gender earnings gap and the resulting substantial increase in upward mobility over a lifetime for women are the driving force behind the increase in long-term mobility among all workers.","['Song, Jae', 'Kopczuk, Wojciech', 'Saez, Emmanuel']","['Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Economic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-']","['D31', 'J31', 'N32']",Earnings Inequality and Mobility in the United States: Evidence from Social Security Data since 1937,0,0,0,0,0,2010,02,01

125,1,2010-02-01,"It is often argued that cost-sharing-charging a subsidized, positive price--for a health product is necessary to avoid wasting resources on those who will not use or do not need the product. We explore this argument through a field experiment in Kenya, in which we randomized the price at which prenatal clinics could sell long-lasting antimalarial insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) to pregnant women. We find no evidence that cost-sharing reduces wastage on those who will not use the product: women who received free ITNs are not less likely to use them than those who paid subsidized positive prices. We also find no evidence that cost-sharing induces selection of women who need the net more: those who pay higher prices appear no sicker than the average prenatal client in the area in terms of measured anemia (an important indicator of malaria). Cost-sharing does, however, considerably dampen demand. We find that uptake drops by sixty percentage points when the price of ITNs increases from zero to $0.60 (i.e., from 100% to 90% subsidy), a price still $0.15 below the price at which ITNs are currently sold to pregnant women in Kenya. We combine our estimates in a cost-effectiveness analysis of the impact of ITN prices on child mortality that incorporates both private and social returns to ITN usage. Overall, our results suggest that free distribution of ITNs could save many more lives than cost-sharing programs have achieved so far, and, given the large positive externality associated with widespread usage of ITNs, would likely do so at a lesser cost per life saved.","['Dupas, Pascaline', 'Cohen, Jessica']","['Analysis of Health Care Markets', 'Health Behavior', 'Health: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health', 'Fertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth', 'Economics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Economic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration']","['I11', 'I12', 'I18', 'J13', 'J16', 'O15']",Free Distribution or Cost-Sharing?

We show that men face a trade-off between the rights they want for their own wives (namely none) and the rights of other women in the economy. Men prefer other men's wives to have rights because men care about their own daughters and because an expansion of women's rights increases educational investments in children.

We find that mothers who give birth to their first child immediately after the reform have more second children than prereform mothers, and that extended parental leave significantly reduces return to work. Employment and earnings also decrease in the short run, but not in the long run. Fertility and work responses vary across the population in ways suggesting that both cash transfers and job protection are relevant. Increasing parental leave for a future child increases fertility strongly but leaves short-run postbirth careers relatively unaffected.

The effect on mortality hazards declines sharply over time, but even twenty years after displacement, we estimate a 10%-15% increase in annual death hazards. If such increases were sustained indefinitely, they would imply a loss in life expectancy of 1.0-1.5 years for a worker displaced at age forty. We show that these results are not due to selective displacement of less healthy workers or to unstable industries or firms offering less healthy work environments. We also show that workers with larger losses in earnings tend to suffer greater increases in mortality. This correlation remains when we examine predicted earnings declines based on losses in industry, firm, or firm-size wage premiums.","['Sullivan, Daniel', 'von Wachter, Till']","['Health Behavior', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Labor Turnover; Vacancies; Layoffs', 'Firm Performance: Size, Diversification, and Scope']","['I12', 'J31', 'J63', 'L25']",Job Displacement and Mortality: An Analysis Using Administrative Data,1,0,0,0,0,2009,08,01

When the annual rate of inflation is low (below 10%-15%), the frequency of price changes comoves weakly with inflation because movements in the frequency of price decreases and increases partly offset each other. In contrast, the average magnitude of price changes correlates strongly with inflation because it is sensitive to movements in the relative shares of price increases and decreases. When inflation rises beyond 10%-15%, few price decreases are observed and both the frequency and average magnitude are important determinants of inflation. I show that a menu-cost model with idiosyncratic technology shocks predicts the average frequency and magnitude of price changes well over a range of inflation similar to that experienced by Mexico.","['Gagnon, Etienne']","['Price Level; Inflation; Deflation', 'Production, Pricing, and Market Structure; Size Distribution of Firms', 'Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development', 'Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes']","['E31', 'L11', 'O11', 'O33']",Price Setting during Low and High Inflation: Evidence from Mexico,1,0,0,1,0,2009,08,01

We develop a model in which product developers can play a useful role in monitoring the deployment of their technology abroad. The analysis demonstrates that when firms want to exploit technologies abroad, multinational firm (MNC) activity and foreign direct investment (FDI) flows arise endogenously when monitoring is nonverifiable and financial frictions exist. The mechanism generating MNC activity is not the risk of technological expropriation by local partners but the demands of external funders who require MNC participation to ensure value maximization by local entrepreneurs. The model demonstrates that weak investor protections limit the scale of MNC activity, increase the reliance on FDI flows, and alter the decision to deploy technology through FDI as opposed to arm's length technology transfers. Several distinctive predictions for the impact of weak investor protection on MNC activity and FDI flows are tested and confirmed using firm-level data.","['Foley, C.

Our method compares successful and unsuccessful applicants in a lottery used by Pakistan to allocate Hajj visas.

We find that participation in the Hajj increases observance of global Islamic practices, such as prayer and fasting, while decreasing participation in localized practices and beliefs, such as the use of amulets and dowry. It increases belief in equality and harmony among ethnic groups and Islamic sects and leads to more favorable attitudes toward women, including greater acceptance of female education and employment. Increased unity within the Islamic world is not accompanied by antipathy toward non-Muslims. Instead, Hajjis show increased belief in peace, and in equality and harmony among adherents of different religions.

We show that the price level responds sluggishly to an exogenous increase in the money stock because the dynamics of households' money inventories leads to a partially offsetting endogenous reduction in velocity. We also show that inflation responds sluggishly to an exogenous increase in the nominal interest rate because changes in monetary policy affect the real interest rate. In a quantitative example, we show that this nominal sluggishness is substantial and persistent if inventories in the model are calibrated to match U.S. households' holdings of M2.","['Atkeson, Andrew', 'Edmond, Chris', 'Alvarez, Fernando']","['Price Level; Inflation; Deflation', 'Demand for Money', 'Money Supply; Credit; Money Multipliers', 'Monetary Policy']","['E31', 'E41', 'E51', 'E52']",Sluggish Responses of Prices and Inflation to Monetary Shocks in an Inventory Model of Money Demand,0,0,0,0,0,2009,08,01

Our findings are consistent with the view that both in Germany and in the United States, technological change is responsible for the widening of the wage distribution at the top. At the bottom of the wage distribution, the increase in inequality is better explained by episodic events, such as supply shocks and changes in labor market institutions. These events happened a decade later in Germany than in the United States.","['Schonberg, Uta', 'Dustmann, Christian', 'Ludsteck, Johannes']","['Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes']","['D31', 'J24', 'J31', 'O33']",Revisiting the German Wage Structure,0,0,0,1,0,2009,05,01

A year after the intervention, treatment communities are more involved in monitoring the provider, and the health workers appear to exert higher effort to serve the community.

We exploit variation in the violence of blockbuster movies from 1995 to 2004, and study the effect on same-day assaults. We find that violent crime decreases on days with larger theater audiences for violent movies. The effect is partly due to voluntary incapacitation: between 6 P.M. and 12 A.M., a one million increase in the audience for violent movies reduces violent crime by 1.1% to 1.3%. After exposure to the movie, between 12 A.M. and 6 A.M., violent crime is reduced by an even larger percent. This finding is explained by the self-selection of violent individuals into violent movie attendance, leading to a substitution away from more volatile activities. In particular, movie attendance appears to reduce alcohol consumption. The results emphasize that media exposure affects behavior not only via content, but also because it changes time spent in alternative activities. The substitution away from more dangerous activities in the field can explain the differences with the laboratory findings. Our estimates suggest that in the short run, violent movies deter almost 1,000 assaults on an average weekend. Although our design does not allow us to estimate long-run effects, we find no evidence of medium-run effects up to three weeks after initial exposure.","['DellaVigna, Stefano', 'Dahl, Gordon']","['Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis', 'Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law', 'Entertainment; Media']","['D12', 'K42', 'L82']",Does Movie Violence Increase Violent Crime?,1,1,0,0,0,2009,05,01

Between 1999 and 2002, we observe little aggregate rebalancing in the financial portfolio of participants. These patterns conceal strong household-level evidence of active rebalancing, which on average offsets about one-half of idiosyncratic passive variations in the risky asset share. Wealthy, educated investors with better diversified portfolios tend to rebalance more actively. We find some evidence that households rebalance toward a greater risky share as they become richer. We also study the decisions to trade individual assets. Households are more likely to fully sell directly held stocks if those stocks have performed well, and more likely to exit direct stockholding if their stock portfolios have performed well; but these relationships are much weaker for mutual funds, a pattern that is consistent with previous research on the disposition effect among direct stockholders and performance sensitivity among mutual fund investors. When households continue to hold individual assets, however, they rebalance both stocks and mutual funds to offset about one-sixth of the passive variations in individual asset shares. Households rebalance primarily by adjusting purchases of risky assets if their risky portfolios have performed poorly, and by adjusting both fund purchases and full sales of stocks if their risky portfolios have performed well. Finally, the tendency for households to fully sell winning stocks is weaker for wealthy investors with diversified portfolios of individual stocks.","['Sodini, Paolo', 'Calvet, Laurent E.', 'Campbell, John Y.']","['Household Saving; Personal Finance', 'Portfolio Choice; Investment Decisions']","['D14', 'G11']",Fight or Flight?

To control for the nonrandom assignment to facilities, we include facility and facility-by-prior-offense fixed effects, thereby estimating peer effects using only within-facility variation over time. We find strong evidence of peer effects for burglary, petty larceny, felony and misdemeanor drug offenses, aggravated assault, and felony sex offenses. The influence of peers primarily affects individuals who already have some experience in a particular crime category. We also find evidence that the predominant types of peer effects differ in residential versus nonresidential facilities; effects in the latter are consistent with network formation among youth serving time close to home.","['Bayer, Patrick', 'Hjalmarsson, Randi', 'Pozen, David']","['State and Local Government: Other Expenditure Categories', 'Fertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth', 'Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law']","['H76', 'J13', 'K42']",Building Criminal Capital behind Bars: Peer Effects in Juvenile Corrections,0,1,0,0,0,2009,02,01

Under weak assumptions, P* is acyclic and therefore suitable for welfare analysis; it is also the most discerning welfare criterion that never overrules choice. The resulting framework generates natural counterparts for the standard tools of applied welfare economics and is easily applied in the context of specific behavioral theories, with novel implications. Though not universally discerning, it lends itself to principled refinements.","['Bernheim, B.

Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we show that compensation in performance-pay jobs is more closely tied to both observed and unobserved productive characteristics of workers than compensation in non-performance-pay jobs. We also find that the return to these productive characteristics increased faster over time in performance-pay than in non-performance-pay jobs. We show that this finding is consistent with the view that underlying changes in returns to skill due, for instance, to technological change induce more firms to offer performance-pay contracts and result in more wage inequality among workers who are paid for performance. Thus, performance pay provides a channel through which underlying changes in returns to skill get translated into higher wage inequality. We conclude that this channel accounts for 21% of the growth in the variance of male wages between the late 1970s and the early 1990s and for most of the increase in wage inequality above the eightieth percentile over the same period.","['MacLeod, W.

Utilizing a comprehensive data set on violent confrontations for the interval between 1401 and 1700 CE, I show that the incidence of military engagements between the Protestant Reformers and the Counter-Reformation forces between the 1520s and 1650s depended negatively on the Ottomans' military activities in Europe. Furthermore, I document that the impact of the Ottomans on Europe went beyond suppressing ecclesiastical conflicts only: at the turn of the sixteenth century, Ottoman conquests lowered the number of all newly initiated conflicts among the Europeans roughly by 25 percent, while they dampened all longer-running feuds by more than 15 percent. The Ottomans' military activities influenced the length of intra-European feuds too, with each Ottoman-European military engagement shortening the duration of intra-European conflicts by more than 50 percent. Thus, while the Protestant Reformation might have benefited from--and perhaps even capitalized on--the Ottoman advances in Europe, the latter seems to have played some role in reducing conflicts within Europe more generally.","['Iyigun, Murat']","['Economic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: Pre-1913', 'Economic History: Government, War, Law, International Relations, and Regulation: Europe: Pre-1913', 'Cultural Economics: Religion']","['N33', 'N43', 'Z12']",Luther and Suleyman,0,0,0,0,0,2008,11,01

The effects of these reforms depend on the market where control rights over incumbent firms are traded. In the absence of a market for control, both reforms increase the number and the average quality of firms, and are politically equivalent. When a market for control exists, financial reform induces less entry than deregulation, and endogenously compensates incumbents, thereby encountering less political opposition from them. Using this result, we show that financial reform may be used in the short run to open the way for future deregulation.

To do this, I exploit newly assembled data on kibbutzim and a financial crisis in the late 1980s that affected them differentially. The main findings are that (1) productive individuals are the most likely to exit and a kibbutz's wealth serves as a lock-in device that increases the value of staying; (2) higher wealth reduces exit and supports a high degree of income equality; and (3) ideology facilitates income equality. Using a simple model, I show that these findings are consistent with a view of the kibbutz as providing optimal insurance when members have the option of leaving. More generally, these findings contribute to an understanding of how mobility limits redistribution, and to an understanding of the determinants of the sharing rule in other types of organizations, such as professional partnerships, cooperatives, and labor-managed firms.","['Abramitzky, Ran']","['Equity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement', 'Social Choice; Clubs; Committees; Associations']","['D63', 'D71']",The Limits of Equality: Insights from the Israeli Kibbutz,0,0,0,0,0,2008,08,01

We compare housing market outcomes in the areas surrounding the first 400 hazardous waste sites chosen for Superfund cleanups to the areas surrounding the 290 sites that narrowly missed qualifying for these cleanups. We find that Superfund cleanups are associated with economically small and statistically insignificant changes in residential property values, property rental rates, housing supply, total population, and types of individuals living near the sites. These findings are robust to a series of specification checks, including the application of a regression discontinuity design based on knowledge of the selection rule. Overall, the preferred estimates suggest that the local benefits of Superfund cleanups are small and appear to be substantially lower than the $43 million mean cost of Superfund cleanups.","['Greenstone, Michael', 'Gallagher, Justin']","['Pollution Control Adoption and Costs; Distributional Effects; Employment Effects', 'Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand']","['Q52', 'R21']",Does Hazardous Waste Matter?

The equilibrium displays strategic complementarities between values and current behavior, which reinforce the effects of changes in the external environment.

An unanswered question in this literature is the effect upon individuals of changes in the opportunity cost of religious participation. In this paper, we identify a policy-driven change in the opportunity cost of religious participation based on state laws that prohibit retail activity on Sunday, known as ""blue laws."" Many states have repealed these laws in recent years, raising the opportunity cost of religious participation. We use a variety of data sets to show that when a state repeals its blue laws religious attendance falls and that church donations and spending fall as well. These results do not seem to be driven by declines in religiosity prior to the law change, nor do we see comparable declines in membership in or giving to nonreligious organizations after a state repeals its laws. We then assess the effects of changes in these laws on drinking and drug use behavior in the NLSY. We find that repealing blue laws leads to an increase in drinking and drug use and that this increase is found only among the initially religious individuals who were affected by the blue laws. The effect is economically significant; for example, the gap in heavy drinking between religious and nonreligious individuals falls by about half after the laws are repealed.","['Hungerman, Daniel M.', 'Gruber, Jonathan']",['Cultural Economics: Religion'],['Z12'],The Church versus the Mall: What Happens When Religion Faces Increased Secular Competition?,0,0,0,0,0,2008,05,01

In a model with heterogeneous plants and quality differentiation, more productive plants produce higher-quality goods than less productive plants, and they pay higher wages to maintain a higher-quality workforce. Only the most productive plants enter the export market, and Southern exporters produce higher-quality goods for export than for the domestic market, to appeal to richer Northern consumers. An exchange-rate devaluation leads more-productive Southern plants to increase exports, upgrade quality, and raise wages relative to less-productive plants within the same industry, increasing within-industry wage dispersion. Using the late-1994 peso crisis as a source of variation and a variety of proxies for plant productivity, I find that initially more productive plants increased the export share of sales, white-collar wages, blue-collar wages, the relative wage of white-collar workers, and ISO 9000 certification more than initially less productive plants during the peso crisis period and that these differential changes were greater than in periods without devaluations before and after the crisis period.

In particular, the model predicts positive as well as zero trade flows across pairs of countries, and it allows the number of exporting firms to vary across destination countries. As a result, the impact of trade frictions on trade flows can be decomposed into the intensive and extensive margins, where the former refers to the trade volume per exporter and the latter refers to the number of exporters. This model yields a generalized gravity equation that accounts for the self-selection of firms into export markets and their impact on trade volumes. We then develop a two-stage estimation procedure that uses an equation for selection into trade partners in the first stage and a trade flow equation in the second. We implement this procedure parametrically, semiparametrically, and nonparametrically, showing that in all three cases the estimated effects of trade frictions are similar. Importantly, our method provides estimates of the intensive and extensive margins of trade. We show that traditional estimates are biased and that most of the bias is due not to selection but rather due to the omission of the extensive margin. Moreover, the effect of the number of exporting firms varies across country pairs according to their characteristics. This variation is large and particularly so for trade between developed and less developed countries and between pairs of less developed countries.","['Rubinstein, Yona', 'Helpman, Elhanan', 'Melitz, Marc']","['Models of Trade with Imperfect Competition and Scale Economies; Fragmentation', 'Empirical Studies of Trade']","['F12', 'F14']",Estimating Trade Flows: Trading Partners and Trading Volumes,0,0,0,0,0,2008,05,01

Unlike variance, negative skewness isolates the impact of the large, infrequent, and abrupt credit busts associated with crises. We find a robust negative link between skewness and GDP growth in a large sample of countries over 1960-2000. This suggests a positive effect of systemic risk on growth. To explain this finding, we present a model in which contract enforceability problems generate borrowing constraints and impede growth. In financially liberalized economies with moderate contract enforceability, systemic risk taking is encouraged and increases investment. This leads to higher mean growth but also to greater incidence of crises.

With the aim of explaining changes in electoral rules adopted by U.S. cities, particularly in the South, we show why majorities tend to adopt ""winner-take-all"" city-wide rules (at-large elections) in response to an increase in the size of the minority when the minority they are facing is relatively small. In this case, for the majority it is more effective to leverage on its sheer size instead of risking conceding representation to voters from minority-elected districts. However, as the minority becomes larger (closer to a fifty-fifty split), the possibility of losing the whole city induces the majority to prefer minority votes to be confined in minority-packed districts. Single-member district rules serve this purpose. We show empirical results consistent with these implications of the model in a novel data set covering U.S. cities and towns from 1930 to 2000.","['Aghion, Philippe', 'Alesina, Alberto', 'Trebbi, Francesco']","['Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination']","['D72', 'J15']",Electoral Rules and Minority Representation in U.S. Cities,0,0,0,0,0,2008,02,01

We develop a conceptual framework to assess when this trade-off is likely to apply and evaluate the evidence for such a trade-off using hiring and productivity data from a national retail firm whose 1,363 stores switched from informal to test-based worker screening over the course of one year. We document that testing yielded more productive hires at this firm-raising mean and median tenure by 10% or more. Consistent with prior research, minorities performed worse on the test. Yet, testing had no measurable impact on minority hiring, and productivity gains were uniformly large among minority and nonminority hires. These results suggest that job testing raised the precision of screening without introducing additional negative information about minority applicants, most plausibly because both the job test and the informal screen that preceded it were unbiased.","['Autor, David H.', 'Scarborough, David']","['Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Labor Demand', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Retail and Wholesale Trade; e-Commerce', 'Personnel Management; Executives; Executive Compensation', 'Personnel Economics: Firm Employment Decisions; Promotions']","['J15', 'J23', 'J24', 'L81', 'M12', 'M51']",Does Job Testing Harm Minority Workers?

As the available public information about the specific technology increases, the tradeoff shifts in favor of centralization.

Second, new IT investments improve the efficiency of all stages of the production process by reducing setup times, run times, and inspection times. The reductions in setup times are theoretically important because they make it less costly to switch production from one product to another and support the change in business strategy to more customized production. Third, adoption of new IT-enhanced capital equipment coincides with increases in the skill requirements of machine operators, notably technical and problem-solving skills, and with the adoption of new human resource practices to support these skills.","['Bartel, Ann', 'Ichniowski, Casey', 'Shaw, Kathryn']","['Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Innovation and Invention: Processes and Incentives']","['J24', 'O31']","How Does Information Technology Affect Productivity?

We analyze a 50% privatization using an overlapping-generations model where heterogeneous agents with elastic labor supply face idiosyncratic earnings shocks and longevity uncertainty. When wage shocks are insurable, privatization produces about $18,100 of extra resources for each future household after all transitional losses have been compensated for with lump-sum taxes. When wages are not insurable, privatization reduces efficiency by about $2,400 per future household. We check the robustness of these results to different model specifications as well as policy reforms and arrive at several surprising conclusions. First, privatization performs better in a closed economy, where interest rates decline with capital accumulation, than in an open economy. Second, privatization also performs better when an actuarially fair private annuity market does not exist.

We estimate the excess sensitivity of job search behavior to cash-on-hand using sharp discontinuities in eligibility for severance pay and extended unemployment insurance (UI) benefits in Austria. Analyzing data for over one-half million job losers, we obtain three empirical results: (1) a lump-sum severance payment equal to two months of earnings reduces the job-finding rate by 8%-12% on average; (2) an extension of the potential duration of UI benefits from 20 weeks to 30 weeks similarly lowers job-finding rates in the first 20 weeks of search by 5%-9%; and (3) increases in the duration of search induced by the two programs have little or no effect on subsequent job match quality. Using a search-theoretic model, we show that estimates of the relative effect of severance pay and extended benefits can be used to calibrate and test a wide set of intertemporal models. Our estimates of this ratio are inconsistent with the predictions of a simple permanent income model, as well as naive rule of thumb behavior.

This paper characterizes risk preferences in an expected utility model with commitments. We show that commitments affect risk preferences in two ways: (1) they amplify risk aversion with respect to moderate-stake shocks, and (2) they create a motive to take large-payoff gambles. The model thus helps resolve two basic puzzles in expected utility theory: the discrepancy between moderate-stake and large-stake risk aversion and lottery playing by insurance buyers. We discuss applications of the model such as the optimal design of social insurance and tax policies, added worker effects in labor supply, and portfolio choice. Using event studies of unemployment shocks, we document evidence consistent with the consumption adjustment patterns implied by the model.","['Chetty, Raj', 'Szeidl, Adam']","['Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis', 'Household Saving; Personal Finance', 'Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty']","['D12', 'D14', 'D81']",Consumption Commitments and Risk Preferences,0,0,0,0,0,2007,05,01

Second, managers select out the least able workers, implying that the mean increases but the dispersion may decrease. In our field experiment we find that the introduction of managerial performance pay raises both the mean and dispersion of worker productivity. Analysis of individual level productivity data shows that managers target their effort towards high ability workers, and the least able workers are less likely to be selected into employment.

The paper uses variation in CEO succession decisions that result from the gender of a departing CEO's firstborn child. This is a plausible instrumental variable (IV), as male first-child firms are more likely to pass on control to a family CEO than are female first-child firms, but the gender of the first child is unlikely to affect firms' outcomes. We find that family successions have a large negative causal impact on firm performance: operating profitability on assets falls by at least four percentage points around CEO transitions.

Hence, there is no prima facie support for the view that international credit frictions play a major role in preventing capital flows from rich to poor countries. Lower capital ratios in these countries are instead attributable to lower endowments of complementary factors and lower efficiency, as well as to lower prices of output goods relative to capital.

We identify three possible reasons: (i) poor countries specialize in fewer and more volatile sectors; (ii) poor countries experience more frequent and more severe aggregate shocks (e.g., from macroeconomic policy); and (iii) poor countries' macroeconomic fluctuations are more highly correlated with the shocks affecting the sectors they specialize in. We show how to decompose volatility into the various sources, quantify their contribution to aggregate volatility, and study how they relate to the stage of development. We document the following regularities. First, as countries develop, their productive structure moves from more volatile to less volatile sectors. Second, the volatility of country-specific macroeconomic shocks falls with development. Third, the covariance between sector-specific and country-specific shocks does not vary systematically with the level of development. There is also some evidence that the degree of sectoral concentration declines with development at early stages, and increases at later stages. We argue that many theories linking volatility and development are not consistent with these findings, and suggest new directions for future theoretical work.","['Koren, Miklos', 'Tenreyro, Silvana']","['Macroeconomics: Production', 'Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development', 'Empirical Studies of Economic Growth; Aggregate Productivity; Cross-Country Output Convergence']","['E23', 'O11', 'O47']",Volatility and Development,0,0,0,0,0,2007,02,01

Debate on health policy often focuses on limiting the growth of health spending. We investigate an issue central to this debate: Is the growth of health spending a rational response to changing economic conditions--notably the growth of income per person? We develop a model based on standard economic assumptions and argue that this is indeed the case. Standard preferences--of the kind used widely in economics to study consumption, asset pricing, and labor supply--imply that health spending is a superior good with an income elasticity well above one. As people get richer and consumption rises, the marginal utility of consumption falls rapidly. Spending on health to extend life allows individuals to purchase additional periods of utility. The marginal utility of life extension does not decline. As a result, the optimal composition of total spending shifts toward health, and the health share grows along with income. In projections based on the quantitative analysis of our model, the optimal health share of spending seems likely to exceed 30 percent by the middle of the century.","['Jones, Charles I.', 'Hall, Robert E.']","['National Government Expenditures and Health', 'Health: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health', 'Value of Life; Forgone Income']","['H51', 'I18', 'J17']",The Value of Life and the Rise in Health Spending,0,0,0,0,0,2007,02,01

This disproportionately larger effect may arise if market-wide changes in demand alter the incentives of hospitals to incur the fixed costs of entering the market or of adopting new practice styles. I present some evidence of these types of effects.

In contrast to the popular view that secondary policies are largely determined by lobbying, we find that there are strong effects of electoral incentives.","['Sturm, Daniel M.', 'List, John A.']","['Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'Environmental Economics: Government Policy']","['D72', 'Q58']",How Elections Matter: Theory and Evidence from Environmental Policy,0,0,0,0,0,2006,11,01

We hypothesize that Iraq deliberately set the price of its oil below market prices to solicit bribes from oil buyers. By comparing the price gap between Iraqi oil and its close substitutes during the Program to the gap prior to the Program, we find evidence of significant underpricing. Our central estimate suggests that Iraq collected $1.3 billion in bribes from underpricing its oil, or 2 percent of oil revenues. Underpricing is higher during periods of high volatility in oil markets--when detection is more difficult--but declines after the UN limited Iraq's ability to set the price of its oil.","['Moretti, Enrico', 'Hsieh, Chang-Tai']","['International Agreements and Observance; International Organizations', 'Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices']","['F53', 'Q41']","Did Iraq Cheat the United Nations?

Applying the model to consumer behavior, we show that willingness to pay for a good is increasing in the expected probability of purchase and in the expected prices conditional on purchase.

Using extremely disaggregated data, we show that the number of imported product varieties has increased by a factor of three. We also estimate the elasticities of substitution for each available category at the same level of aggregation, and describe their behavior across time and SITC industries.

Such shrouding creates an inefficiency, which firms may have an incentive to eliminate by educating their competitors' customers. However, if add-ons have close substitutes, a ""curse of debiasing"" arises, and firms will not be able to profitably debias consumers by unshrouding add-ons. In equilibrium, two kinds of exploitation coexist. Optimizing firms exploit myopic consumers through marketing schemes that shroud high-priced add-ons. In turn, sophisticated consumers exploit these marketing schemes. It is not possible to profitably drive away the business of sophisticates.

The data are from students and recent graduates of Dartmouth College. First-year students interact with peers in their immediate proximity and form long-term friendships with a subset of these people. This result is consistent with a model in which the expected value of interacting with an unknown person is low (making traveling solely to meet new people unlikely), while the benefits from interacting with the same person repeatedly are high. Geographic proximity and race are greater determinants of social interaction than are common interests, majors, or family background. Two randomly chosen White students interact three times more often than do a Black student and a White student. However, placing the Black and White student in the same freshman dorm increases their frequency of interaction by a factor of three.

To study this question, we propose a theory of the assignment of heterogeneous agents into hierarchical teams, where less skilled agents specialize in production and more skilled agents specialize in problem solving. We first analyze the properties of the competitive equilibrium of the model in a closed economy, and show that the model has a unique and efficient solution. We then study the equilibrium of a two-country model (North and South), where countries differ in their distributions of ability, and in which agents in different countries can join together in teams. We refer to this type of integration as globalization. Globalization leads to better matches for all southern workers but only for the best northern workers. As a result, we show that globalization increases wage inequality among nonmanagers in the South, but not necessarily in the North. We also study how globalization affects the size distribution of firms and the patterns of consumption and trade in the global economy.","['Rossi-Hansberg, Esteban', 'Garicano, Luis', 'Antras, Pol']","['Trade and Labor Market Interactions', 'Multinational Firms; International Business', 'Personnel Economics: Labor Contracting Devices']","['F16', 'F23', 'M55']",Offshoring in a Knowledge Economy,0,0,0,0,0,2006,02,01

To determine the price that it will pay for each drug, Medicaid uses the average private sector price. When Medicaid is a large part of the demand for a drug, this creates an incentive for its maker to increase prices for other health care consumers. Using drug utilization and expenditure data for the top 200 drugs in 1997 and in 2002, we investigate the relationship between the Medicaid market share (MMS) and the average price of a prescription. Our estimates imply that a 10-percentage-point increase in the MMS is associated with a 7 to 10 percent increase in the average price of a prescription. In addition, the Medicaid rules increase a firm's incentive to introduce new versions of a drug in order to raise price. We find empirical evidence that firms producing newer drugs with larger sales to Medicaid are more likely to introduce new versions. Taken together, our findings suggest that government procurement rules can alter equilibrium price and product proliferation in the private sector.","['Scott Morton, Fiona M.', 'Duggan, Mark']","['National Government Expenditures and Related Policies: Procurement', 'Analysis of Health Care Markets', 'Oligopoly and Other Imperfect Markets']","['H57', 'I11', 'L13']",The Distortionary Effects of Government Procurement: Evidence from Medicaid Prescription Drug Purchasing,1,0,0,0,0,2006,02,01

To balance these opposing forces, the majority rule should increase in the project's value and the club's enforcement capacity but decrease in the heterogeneity in preferences.

Agents differ in their income and in their age, where young agents prefer public education and the old prefer income redistribution. I find that when the cohort size of the young is not too large then public education arises as a political compromise between the rich and the young segment of the poor. They collude in order to reduce the size of government (which benefits the rich) and target some of its resources to education (which benefits the young poor). When the cohort size of the young is too large, however, income redistribution crowds out public provision of education in the political equilibrium.","['Levy, Gilat']","['Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'National Government Expenditures and Education', 'Analysis of Education', 'Education: Government Policy']","['D72', 'H52', 'I21', 'I28']",The Politics of Public Provision of Education,0,0,0,0,0,2005,11,01

The paper also shows that political concerns play a significant role in delaying government interventions to failing banks. Failing banks are much less likely to be taken over by the government or to lose their licenses before elections than after. This result is robust to controlling for macroeconomic and bank-specific factors, a new party in power, early elections, outstanding loans from the IMF, as well as country-specific, time-independent factors.

Using a loan-level data set of more than 90,000 firms that represents the universe of corporate lending in Pakistan between 1996 and 2002, we investigate rents to politically connected firms in banking. Classifying a firm as ""political"" if its director participates in an election, we examine the extent, nature, and economic costs of political rent provision. We find that political firms borrow 45 percent more and have 50 percent higher default rates. Such preferential treatment occurs exclusively in government banks--private banks provide no political favors. Using firm fixed effects and exploiting variation for the same firm across lenders or over time allows for cleaner identification of the political preference result. We also find that political rents increase with the strength of the firm's politician and whether he or his party is in power, and fall with the degree of electoral participation in his constituency. We provide direct evidence against alternative explanations such as socially motivated lending by government banks to politicians.

The probability of state religion decreases sharply under Communism, but lagged Communism has only a weak effect.

The data's panel nature and rich set of measures of well-being and behavior indicate that this association is not driven by selection or by changes in the way people define happiness.

We document a 20 percent increase in dividend payments by nonfinancial, nonutility publicly traded corporations following the tax cut. An unusually large number of firms initiated or increased regular dividend payments in the year after the reform. As a result, the number of firms paying dividends began to increase in 2003 after a continuous decline for more than two decades. Firms with high levels of nontaxable institutional ownership did not change payout policies, supporting the causality of the tax cut in increasing aggregate dividend payments. The response to the tax cut was strongest in firms with strong principals whose tax incentives changed (those with large taxable institutional owners or independent directors with large share holdings), and in firms where agents had stronger incentives to respond (high share ownership and low options ownership among top executives). Hence, principal-agent issues appear to play an important role in corporate responses to taxation.","['Chetty, Raj', 'Saez, Emmanuel']","['Payout Policy', 'Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities; Redistributive Effects; Environmental Taxes and Subsidies', 'Personal Income and Other Nonbusiness Taxes and Subsidies; includes inheritance and gift taxes', 'Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents: Firm']","['G35', 'H23', 'H24', 'H32']",Dividend Taxes and Corporate Behavior: Evidence from the 2003 Dividend Tax Cut,0,0,0,0,0,2005,08,01

120,2,2005-05-01,"This paper examines competitive price discrimination with horizontal and vertical taste differences. Consumers with higher valuations for quality are assumed to have stronger brand preferences. Two models are considered: a standard competitive price discrimination model in which consumers observe all prices; and an ""add-on pricing"" game in which add-on prices are naturally unobserved and firms may advertise a base good at a low price in hopes of selling add-ons at high unadvertised prices. In the standard game price discrimination is self-reinforcing: the model sometimes has both equilibria in which the firms practice price discrimination and equilibria in which they do not. The analysis of the add-on pricing game focuses on the Chicago-school argument that profits earned on add-ons will be competed away via lower prices for advertised goods. A conclusion is that add-on practices can raise equilibrium profits by creating an adverse selection problem that makes price-cutting unappealing. Although profitable when jointly adopted, using add-on pricing is not individually rational in a simple extension with endogenous advertising practices and costless advertising. Several models that could account for add-on pricing are discussed.","['Ellison, Glenn']","['Production, Pricing, and Market Structure; Size Distribution of Firms', 'Oligopoly and Other Imperfect Markets', 'Advertising']","['L11', 'L13', 'M37']",A Model of Add-On Pricing,1,0,0,0,0,2005,05,01

This paper addresses the question of why Africa has been so heavily affected by HIV, and what explains the variation within Africa. I present a model that decomposes epidemic level into differences in sexual behavior and differences in viral transmission rates. I argue, using evidence drawn from the existing medical literature, that Africa has very high HIV transmission rates, likely due to high rates of other untreated sexually transmitted infections, while transmission rates in the United States are low. The difference in transmission rates is large enough to explain the observed difference in prevalence between the United States and Sub-Saharan Africa. The model also provides a good fit to cross-country data within Africa and suggests that, in contrast to the intracontinental results, differences within that continent can be attributed to differences in sexual behavior and epidemic timing. The results suggest that cost effective policy interventions would focus on decreasing transmission rates within Africa, possibly by treating other untreated sexually transmitted infections.","['Oster, Emily']","['Health Behavior', 'Economics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Economic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration']","['I12', 'J16', 'O15']","Sexually Transmitted Infections, Sexual Behavior, and the HIV/AIDS Epidemic",0,0,0,0,0,2005,05,01

120,1,2005-02-01,"Structural vector autoregressions (VARs) are widely used to trace out the effect of monetary policy innovations on the economy. However, the sparse information sets typically used in these empirical models lead to at least three potential problems with the results. First, to the extent that central banks and the private sector have information not reflected in the VAR, the measurement of policy innovations is likely to be contaminated. Second, the choice of a specific data series to represent a general economic concept such as ""real activity"" is often arbitrary to some degree. Third, impulse responses can be observed only for the included variables, which generally constitute only a small subset of the variables that the researcher and policy-maker care about. In this paper we investigate one potential solution to this limited information problem, which combines the standard structural VAR analysis with recent developments in factor analysis for large data sets. We find that the information that our factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) methodology exploits is indeed important to properly identify the monetary transmission mechanism.

In the absence of perfect capital markets, the economy can converge to different steady states, depending upon initial conditions. The degree of marital sorting and wage inequality is positively correlated across steady states and negatively correlated with per capita income. We use household surveys from 34 countries to construct several measures of the skill premium and of the degree of correlation of spouses' education (marital sorting). For all our measures, we find a positive and significant relationship between the two variables. We also find that sorting and per capita GDP are negatively correlated and that greater discrimination against women leads to more sorting, in line with the predictions of our model.","['Fernandez, Raquel', 'Knowles, John', 'Guner, Nezih']","['Household Production and Intrahousehold Allocation', 'Marriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity']","['D13', 'J12', 'J24']",Love and Money: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis of Household Sorting and Inequality,0,0,0,0,0,2005,02,01

Hatred relies on people accepting, rather than investigating, hate-creating stories. Hatred declines when there is private incentive to learn the truth.

Estimates are also confounded by selection bias, because unions could organize at highly profitable enterprises that are more likely to grow and pay higher wages. Using multiple establishment-level data sets that represent establishments that faced organizing drives in the United States during 1984-1999, this paper uses a regression discontinuity design to estimate the impact of unionization on business survival, employment, output, productivity, and wages. Essentially, outcomes for employers where unions barely won the election (e.g., by one vote) are compared with those where the unions barely lost. The analysis finds small impacts on all outcomes that we examine; estimates for wages are close to zero.

In the first step of the acquisition, the raider acquires a majority of the target's stock through a tender offer. In a second step, the target is merged with the raider's indebted acquisition subsidiary. The fact that the acquisition subsidiary is indebted lowers the combined firm's share value and thus the incentives for target shareholders to hold out in the tender offer.

To assess the widely held affirmative view, we introduce investor protection into a standard overlapping generations model of capital accumulation. Better investor protection implies better risk sharing. Because of entrepreneurs' risk aversion, this results in a larger demand for capital. This is the demand effect. A second effect (the supply effect) follows from general equilibrium restrictions. Better protection (i.e., higher demand) increases the interest rate and lowers the income of entrepreneurs, decreasing current savings and next period's supply of capital. The supply effect is stronger the tighter are the restrictions on capital flows. Our model thus predicts that the (positive) effect of investor protection on growth is stronger for countries with lower restrictions.

We study how this effect leads to preferences of citizens over constitutions; and ultimately how this has a feedback that determines which constitutions can survive in a given society. Constitutions are stylized here, to consist of a voting rule for ordinary business and possibly a different voting rule for making changes to the constitution. We define an equilibrium notion for constitutions, called self-stability, whereby under the rules of a self-stable constitution, the society would not vote to change the constitution. We argue that only self-stable constitutions will endure. We prove that self-stable constitutions always exist, but that most constitutions (even very prominent ones) may not be self-stable for some societies. We show that constitutions where the voting rule used to amend the constitution is the same as the voting rule used for ordinary business are dangerously simplistic, and there are (many) societies for which no such constitution is self-stable. We conclude with a characterization of the set of self-stable constitutions that use majority rule for ordinary business.","['Jackson, Matthew O.', 'Barbera, Salvador']","['Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior']",['D72'],Choosing How to Choose: Self-Stable Majority Rules and Constitutions,0,0,0,0,0,2004,08,01

We construct a new indicator of financial development by estimating a regional effect on the probability that, ceteris paribus, a household is shut off from the credit market. By using this indicator, we find that financial development enhances the probability an individual starts his own business, favors entry of new firms, increases competition, and promotes growth. As predicted by theory, these effects are weaker for larger firms, which can more easily raise funds outside of the local area. These effects are present even when we instrument our indicator with the structure of the local banking markets in 1936, which, because of regulatory reasons, affected the supply of credit in the following 50 years.

In one view, voters can affect candidates' policy choices: competition for votes induces politicians to move toward the center. In this view, elections have the effect of bringing about some degree of policy compromise. In the alternative view, voters merely elect policies: politicians cannot make credible promises to moderate their policies, and elections are merely a means to decide which one of two opposing policy views will be implemented. We assess which of these contrasting perspectives is more empirically relevant for the U.S. House. Focusing on elections decided by a narrow margin allows us to generate quasi-experimental estimates of the impact of a ""randomized"" change in electoral strength on subsequent representatives' roll-call voting records. We find that voters merely elect policies: the degree of electoral strength has no effect on a legislator's voting behavior. For example, a large exogenous increase in electoral strength for the Democratic party in a district does not result in shifting both parties' nominees to the left. Politicians' inability to credibly commit to a compromise appears to dominate any competition-induced convergence in policy.","['Moretti, Enrico', 'Butler, Matthew J.', 'Lee, David S.']","['Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'Economic History: Government, War, Law, International Relations, and Regulation: U.S.; Canada: 1913-']","['D72', 'N42']",Do Voters Affect or Elect Policies?

One of the large public programs was a capitation grant to cover schools' nonwage expenditures. Using panel data from a unique survey of primary schools, we assess the extent to which the grant actually reached the intended end-user (schools). The survey data reveal that during 1991-1995, the schools, on average, received only 13 percent of the grants. Most schools received nothing. The bulk of the school grant was captured by local officials (and politicians). The data also reveal considerable variation in grants received across schools, suggesting that rather than being passive recipients of flows from the government, schools use their bargaining power to secure greater shares of funding. We find that schools in better-off communities managed to claim a higher share of their entitlements. As a result, actual education spending, in contrast to budget allocations, is regressive.

Exchanges are also made in which a donor-patient pair makes a donation to someone waiting for a cadaver kidney, in return for the patient in the pair receiving high priority for a compatible cadaver kidney when one becomes available. There are stringent legal/ethical constraints on how exchanges can be conducted. We explore how larger scale exchanges of these kinds can be arranged efficiently and incentive compatibly, within existing constraints. The problem resembles some of the ""housing"" problems studied in the mechanism design literature for indivisible goods, with the novel feature that while live donor kidneys can be assigned simultaneously, cadaver kidneys cannot.

Second, firms price leisure goods above marginal cost. Third, for all types of goods firms introduce switching costs and charge back-loaded fees. The contractual design targets consumer misperception of future consumption and underestimation of the renewal probability.

Bundling allows an incumbent to credibly defend both products without having to price low in each.

We also assess the importance of four channels through which maternal education may improve birth outcomes: use of prenatal care, smoking, marriage, and fertility. In an effort to account for the endogeneity of educational attainment, we use data about the availability of colleges in the woman's county in her seventeenth year as an instrument for maternal education. We find that higher maternal education improves infant health, as measured by birth weight and gestational age. It also increases the probability that a new mother is married, reduces parity, increases use of prenatal care, and reduces smoking, suggesting that these may be important pathways for the ultimate effect on health. Our results add to the growing body of literature which suggests that estimates of the returns to education which focus only on increases in wages understate the total return.","['Moretti, Enrico', 'Currie, Janet']","['Economics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Fertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth']","['J16', 'J24', 'J13']",Mother's Education and the Intergenerational Transmission of Human Capital: Evidence from College Openings,0,0,0,0,0,2003,11,01

In an environment with uncertain inflation a nominal FRM has a risky real capital value, whereas an ARM has a stable real capital value but short-term variability in required real payments. Numerical solution of a life-cycle model with borrowing constraints and income risk shows that an ARM is generally attractive, but less so for a risk-averse household with a large mortgage, risky income, high default cost, or low moving probability. An inflation-indexed FRM can improve substantially on standard nominal mortgages.","['Cocco, Joao F.', 'Campbell, John Y.']","['Household Saving; Personal Finance', 'Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages']","['D14', 'G21']",Household Risk Management and Optimal Mortgage Choice,0,0,0,0,0,2003,11,01

In a panel of industries, the share of intrafirm imports in total U. S. imports is significantly higher, the higher the capital intensity of the exporting industry. In a cross section of countries the share of intrafirm imports in total U. S. imports is significantly higher, the higher the capital-labor ratio of the exporting country. I then show that these patterns can be rationalized in a theoretical framework that combines a Grossman-Hart-Moore view of the firm with a Helpman-Krugman view of international trade. In particular, I develop an incomplete-contracting, property-rights model of the boundaries of the firm, which I then incorporate into a standard trade model with imperfect competition and product differentiation. The model pins down the boundaries of multinational firms as well as the international location of production, and it is shown to predict the patterns of intrafirm trade identified above. Econometric evidence reveals that the model is consistent with other qualitative and quantitative features of the data.","['Antras, Pol']","['Empirical Studies of Trade', 'Multinational Firms; International Business', 'Industry Studies: Manufacturing: General']","['F14', 'F23', 'L60']","Firms, Contracts, and Trade Structure",1,0,0,0,0,2003,11,01

We argue that computer capital (1) substitutes for workers in performing cognitive and manual tasks that can be accomplished by following explicit rules; and (2) complements workers in performing nonroutine problem-solving and complex communications tasks. Provided that these tasks are imperfect substitutes, our model implies measurable changes in the composition of job tasks, which we explore using representative data on task input for 1960 to 1998. We find that within industries, occupations, and education groups, computerization is associated with reduced labor input of routine manual and routine cognitive tasks and increased labor input of nonroutine cognitive tasks. Translating task shifts into education demand, the model can explain 60 percent of the estimated relative demand shift favoring college labor during 1970 to 1998. Task changes within nominally identical occupations account for almost half of this impact.","['Autor, David H.', 'Murnane, Richard J.', 'Levy, Frank']","['Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity', 'Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes', 'Capital Budgeting; Fixed Investment and Inventory Studies; Capacity', 'Labor Demand']","['J24', 'O33', 'G31', 'J23']",The Skill Content of Recent Technological Change: An Empirical Exploration,0,0,0,1,0,2003,11,01

We construct a manager-firm matched panel data set which enables us to track the top managers across different firms over time. We find that manager fixed effects matter for a wide range of corporate decisions. A significant extent of the heterogeneity in investment, financial, and organizational practices of firms can be explained by the presence of manager fixed effects. We identify specific patterns in managerial decision-making that appear to indicate general differences in ""style"" across managers. Moreover, we show that management style is significantly related to manager fixed effects in performance and that managers with higher performance fixed effects receive higher compensation and are more likely to be found in better governed firms. In a final step, we tie back these findings to observable managerial characteristics. We find that executives from earlier birth cohorts appear on average to be more conservative; on the other hand, managers who hold an MBA degree seem to follow on average more aggressive strategies.","['Bertrand, Marianne', 'Schoar, Antoinette']","['Mergers; Acquisitions; Restructuring; Voting; Proxy Contests; Corporate Governance', 'Business Administration: General', 'Capital Budgeting; Fixed Investment and Inventory Studies; Capacity', 'Financing Policy; Financial Risk and Risk Management; Capital and Ownership Structure; Value of Firms; Goodwill']","['G34', 'M10', 'G31', 'G32']",Managing with Style: The Effect of Managers on Firm Policies,0,0,0,0,1,2003,11,01

Most of these effects are driven by fewer deaths occurring within one month of birth, suggesting that fetal exposure is a potential pathophysiologic mechanism. The analysis also reveals nonlinear effects of TSPs pollution and greater sensitivity of black infant mortality at the county level.

In a laboratory experiment we observe, as we increase the competitiveness of the environment, a significant increase in performance for men, but not for women. This results in a significant gender gap in performance in tournaments, while there is no gap when participants are paid according to piece rate. This effect is stronger when women have to compete against men than in single-sex competitive environments: this suggests that women may be able to perform in competitive environments per se.","['Niederle, Muriel', 'Rustichini, Aldo', 'Gneezy, Uri']","['Economics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination', 'Labor Discrimination']","['J16', 'J71']",Performance in Competitive Environments: Gender Differences,0,0,0,0,0,2003,08,01

We use data from an immigrant policy initiative in Sweden, when government authorities distributed refugee immigrants across locales in a way that we argue is exogenous. This policy initiative provides a unique natural experiment, which allows us to estimate the causal effect on labor market outcomes of living in enclaves.

The data are especially suited to test a theory of dynamic contracting since they include information on the entire profile of future premiums. All the patterns in the data fit the theoretical predictions of a model with symmetric learning and one-sided commitment a la Harris and Holmstom. The lack of commitment by consumers shapes contracts in the way predicted by the theory: all contracts involve front-loading (prepayment) of premiums. Front-loading generates a partial lock-in of consumers; more front-loading is associated with lower lapsation. Moreover, contracts that are more front-loaded have a lower present value of premiums over the period of coverage. This is consistent with the idea that front-loading enhances consumer commitment and that more front-loaded contracts retain better risk pools.","['Lizzeri, Alessandro', 'Hendel, Igal']","['Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design', 'Insurance; Insurance Companies; Actuarial Studies', 'Intertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving']","['D82', 'G22', 'D15']",The Role of Commitment in Dynamic Contracts: Evidence from Life Insurance,0,0,0,0,0,2003,02,01

We propose an explanation for these patterns, based on differences in control rights and bargaining strength across firms. Consistent with the control rights/bargaining hypotheses, we find that the incidence of corruption can be explained by the variation in policies/regulations across industries. How much must bribepaying firms pay? Combining the quantitative data on corruption with detailed financial information from the surveyed firms, we show that firms' ""ability to pay"" and firms' ""refusal power"" can explain a large part of the variation in bribes across graft-reporting firms.

The flow of immigrants affected the second-generation marriage market because second-generation marriages were mostly endogamous, i.e., to members of the same ethnic group. The empirical results suggest that high sex ratios had a large positive effect on the likelihood of female marriage, and a large negative effect on female labor force participation. Perhaps surprisingly, the marriage rates of second-generation men appear to be a slightly increasing function of immigrant sex ratios.

An acceleration in the rate of quality improvement of equipment, like the one observed from the early 1970s, increases the productivity/quality differentials across machines (jobs). In a frictional labor market, this force translates into higher wage dispersion even among ex ante equal workers. With vintage-human capital, the acceleration reduces workers' capacity to transfer skills from old to new machines, generating a rise in the cross-sectional variance of skills, and therefore of wages. Through calibration, the paper shows that this mechanism can account for 30 percent of the surge in residual inequality in the U.S. economy (or for most of its transitory component). Two key implications of the theory--faster within-job wage growth and larger wage losses upon displacement--find empirical support in the data.","['Violante, Giovanni L.']","['Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes', 'Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity']","['J31', 'O33', 'J24']","Technological Acceleration, Skill Transferability, and the Rise in Residual Inequality",0,0,0,1,0,2002,02,01

The young would like to borrow and invest in equity but the borrowing constraint prevents them from doing so. The middle-aged choose to hold a diversified portfolio that includes positive holdings of bonds, and this explains the demand for bonds.

Political transition, rather than redistribution under existing political institutions, occurs because current transfers do not ensure future transfers, while the extension of the franchise changes future political equilibria and acts as a commitment to redistribution.

Segments of the economy that are freed from centralized control respond to the rent-seeking opportunities implicit in the remaining distortions of the economy. The battle to capture, and then protect, these rents leads to the creation of new distortions, even as the reform process tries to move forward. In this paper I illustrate this idea with a study of the People's Republic of China. Under the plan, prices were skewed so as to concentrate profits, and hence revenue, in industry. As control over factor allocations was loosened, local governments throughout the economy sought to capture these rents by developing high margin industries. Continued reform, and growing interregional competition between duplicative industries, threatened the profitability of these industrial structures, leading local governments to impose a variety of interregional barriers to trade. Thus, the reform process led to the fragmentation of the domestic market and the distortion of regional production away from patterns of comparative advantage.","['Young, Alwyn']","['Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: General', 'Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior', 'Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Performance and Prospects', 'Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: National Income, Product, and Expenditure; Money; Inflation']","['P20', 'D72', 'P27', 'P24']",The Razor's Edge: Distortions and Incremental Reform in the People's Rupublic of China,0,0,0,0,0,2000,11,01

113,2,1998-05-01,This paper attempts to provide microfoundations for the knowledge production function in an idea-based growth model. Production of new ideas is made a function of newly reconfigured old ideas in the spirit of the way an agricultural research station develops improved plant varieties by cross-pollinating existing plant varieties. The model shows how knowledge can build upon itself in a combinatoric feedback process that may have significant implications for economic growth. The paper's main theme is that the ultimate limits to growth lie not so much in the ability to generate new ideas as in the ability to process an abundance of potentially new ideas into usable form.,"['Weitzman, Martin L.']","['One, Two, and Multisector Growth Models', 'Search; Learning; Information and Knowledge; Communication; Belief; Unawareness']","['O41', 'D83']",Recombinant Growth,0,0,0,0,0,1998,05,01

The optimal dispersion of share ownership can be achieved by going public, but this choice also entails some costs (the cost of listing and the loss of control over the shareholder register). If the controlling shareholder sells shares privately instead, he avoids the costs of going public but must tolerate large external shareholders who may monitor him too closely. Thus, the owner faces a trade-off between the cost of providing a liquid market and overmonitoring. The incentive to go public is stronger, the larger the amount of external funding required.

This paper asks what determines privatization prices using firm-level data for all 236 Mexican companies privatized between 1983 and 1992. There are three main reasons why net prices--auction prices net of the cost of prior restructuring measures--are low, averaging 54 cents per dollar of assets. First, privatization prices are very sensitive to the level of competition in the auction and restrictions often limited participation. Second, the privatization process took too long, and lengthier privatizations are associated with lower premiums. Third, firm prior restructuring measures absorbed an average of 33 percent of the auction price. Most restructuring measures do not increase price and delay privatization further.

When price adjustment is costly, firms adjust to large shocks but not to small shocks, and so large shocks have disproportionate effects on the price level. Therefore, aggregate inflation depends on the distribution of relative-price changes: inflation rises when the distribution is skewed to the right, and falls when the distribution is skewed to the left. The authors show that this theoretical result explains a large fraction of movements in postwar U.S. inflation. Moreover, their model suggests measures of supply shocks that perform better than traditional measures, such as the relative prices of food and energy.","['Mankiw, N.

The combination of secured private debt and numerous public debt issues seems to impede out-of-court restructurings and increases the probability of a Chapter 11 filing. In addition, the authors find that, while asset sales are a way of avoiding Chapter 11, they are limited by industry factors: firms in distressed and highly leveraged industries are less prone to sell assets.","['Asquith, Paul', 'Gertner, Robert', 'Scharfstein, David']","['Financing Policy; Financial Risk and Risk Management; Capital and Ownership Structure; Value of Firms; Goodwill', 'Bankruptcy; Liquidation']","['G32', 'G33']",Anatomy of Financial Distress: An Examination of Junk-Bond Issuers,0,0,0,0,0,1994,08,01

For plausible parameterizations the consumption smoothing effect tends to dominate the relative wage effect; transition from relatively low levels of physical capital is accomplished through higher work effort rather than higher savings.","['Mulligan, Casey B.', 'Sala-i-Martin, Xavier']","['One, Two, and Multisector Growth Models']",['O41'],Transitional Dynamics in Two-Sector Models of Endogenous Growth,0,0,0,0,0,1993,08,01

To answer these questions, we use novel high frequency data from France on the incidence of a number of viral diseases across space, for different age groups, over a quarter of a century. We use quasi-experimental variation to evaluate the importance of policies reducing interpersonal contacts such as school closures or the closure of public transportation networks. While these policies significantly reduce disease prevalence, we find that they are not cost-effective. We find that expansions of transportation networks have significant health costs in increasing the spread of viruses, and that propagation rates are pro-cyclically sensitive to economic conditions and increase with inter-regional trade.","['Adda, Jerome']","['Health Behavior', 'Health: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health', 'Education: Government Policy', 'Size and Spatial Distributions of Regional Economic Activity', 'Transportation Economics: Government Pricing and Policy']","['I12', 'I18', 'I28', 'R12', 'R48']",Economic Activity and the Spread of Viral Diseases: Evidence from High Frequency Data,0,0,0,0,0,2016,05,01

Movements in the college wage premium over this period appear to be strongly related to fluctuations in the rate of growth of the supply of college graduates.","['Katz, Lawrence F.', 'Murphy, Kevin M.']","['Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials', 'Labor Demand', 'Time Allocation and Labor Supply']","['J31', 'J23', 'J22']","Changes in Relative Wages, 1963-1987: Supply and Demand Factors",0,0,0,0,0,1992,02,01
107,1,1992-02-01,"The era of wage stretching has been a current focus, but the authors direct attention here to a decade of extraordinary wage compression--the 1940s. Wages narrowed by education, job experience, and occupation, and compression occurred within cells. The 90-10 differential in the log of wages for men was 1.45 in 1940 but 1.06 in 1950. By the late 1980s it returned to its 1940 level, thus restoring a dispersion of 50 years ago. World War II and the National War Labor Board share some credit for the Great Compression, but much was due to an increased demand for unskilled labor when educated labor was greatly expanding.","['Goldin, Claudia', 'Margo, Robert A.']",['Wage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials'],['J31'],The Great Compression: The Wage Structure in the United States at Mid-century,0,0,0,0,0,1992,02,01

105,4,1990-11-01,This paper empirically examines the importance of explicitly accounting for the layoff-rehire process in the analysis of unemployment outcomes in the United States. The authors find that the spells of individuals who initially expect to be recalled account for much more of the unemployment of unemployment insurance recipients that do spells actually ending in recall. The results indicate that the recall and new job escape rates from unemployment have quite different time patterns and are often affected in opposite ways by explanatory variables. The authors also find that the probability of leaving unemployment both through recalls and new job finding increases greatly around the time that unemployment insurance benefits lapse.,"['Katz, Lawrence F.', 'Meyer, Bruce D.']",[nan],[nan],"Unemployment Insurance, Recall Expectations, and Unemployment Outcomes",0,0,0,0,0,1990,11,01
