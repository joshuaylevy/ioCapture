# Economists Capture Project
What to prepare for the meeting with everyone? (Week of 25/07)

Summary statistics for the data we gathered in general
-	How many articles 
-	How many articles per journal
-	How many authors
-	How many articles per author
-	Top authors per journal
-	JEL codes per journal over time

## Consultants:
-	Who are they in terms of name; Affiliation, if possible gender and cohort (year of finishing PhD)
    - Add nationality later
-	How many people in the NBER databases are also consultants per field
    -	Within and in-between consulting: check research associate or research fellow at the NBER
-	Where are consultants publishing in terms of journals and dates (as a measure of productivity)
-	How many clearly disclosed their consultancy
    -	Where was it disclosed? CV, page, etc.?
        - 1 point per instance of disclosure (sum over all points)
-	JEL codes for consultants over time


## Editors:
-	How many editors per journal
-	Average tenure, longest tenure.
-	Affiliation, gender, cohort, ethnicity
-	How many editors are consultants vs non-consultants
-	How many publications in your own journal vs. third-party journal (for the limited sample of journals)
    - Defining "published while editor" in the same journal
    - Use the articles as the unit of observation?
-	Do diversity of JEL Codes go up and down if an editor takes over?
    - Compute a Shannon Diversity Index for the lead/main/editor-in-chief (so at the volume level?)
    - If there is more than one primary editor, consider the composition of the editorial board
-	Do people move between journals? And How?



## For the future:
- Among *only* the consultants -- build out a co-author network
- Do some measure of market-share per consulting firm
- Search per consult, all articles in the SCOPUS database


## Questions to ask:
- How much of the long-tail of unmatched articles do we want to keep?
- Discussing the ALJ (and the three types of journals that we have (Association/Department/Corporate))
- How do we want to use the editor-database?
  -  How do we standardize editor-titles between journals?
     -  Chiefs v non-chiefs
  -  The consultants' share of the editorial staff for any given volume
-  IRB approval (particularly if we want to surveying people)
-  How are we going to code the anti-trust positions of given articles?
