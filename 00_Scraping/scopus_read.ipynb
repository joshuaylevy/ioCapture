    "#Given a pub_code (see 'collection_dict' keys), this function identifies the publication-specific df generated by 'publication_collect', and generates two new dfs: 1) authors and abstract and funding; and 2) the citations that the article of interest makes. It then merges these back on to the pub_df (1:m) and returns that updated pub_df. We DO NOT merge on 'doi' (even though it should be a unique identifier) because if a SCOPUS object does not have an doi it the obersvation is coded as 'SCOPUS FAILURE' generically. This causes a (m:m) merge that is way too big/inaccurate. Instead we merge on 'sc_abstract_endpoint' which is a unique identifier generated by SCOPUS.\n",
