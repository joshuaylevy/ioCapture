The agent works for the principal and simultaneously pursues outside rewards. The contract offered by the principal thus manipulates the agent's work-life balance. The participation constraint is slack whenever it is optimal to distort the agent's work-life balance away from life compared to a symmetric-information benchmark.

Such exchanges allow competitors to closely monitor each other, thereby facilitating collusion. But the exchange of aggregate information, perhaps via a third party, is legal. The logic is that collusion is difficult if the identity of a price-cutting firm cannot be ascertained. Here, we examine this logic using Stigler's model of secret price cuts.

I study such markets when firms compete repeatedly. By observing their customers' usage patterns, firms acquire private information about their level of naivete. First, I find that private information on naivete mitigates competition and is of great value even with homogeneous products. Second, competition between initially symmetrically informed firms is mitigated when firms can educate naifs about mistakes. In an analogous setting without naifs, the second result does not occur; the first result occurs when firms cannot disclose fees.","['Johnen, Johannes']","['Firm Behavior: Theory', 'Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design', 'Economics of Contract: Theory']","['D21', 'D82', 'D86']",Dynamic Competition in Deceptive Markets,0,0,0,0,0,2020,06,01

Due to the limited capacity of the rival, the dominant firm has a captive portion of the buyer's demand for the single product. As compared to linear pricing, the dominant firm can use AUDs to go beyond its captive portion by tying its captive demand with part of the competitive demand and partially foreclose its small rival. When the rival's capacity level is well below relevant demand, AUDs reduce the buyer's surplus.","['Wong, Adam Chi Leung', 'Chao, Yong', 'Tan, Guofu']","['Firm Behavior: Theory', 'Market Structure, Pricing, and Design: Oligopoly and Other Forms of Market Imperfection', 'Oligopoly and Other Imperfect Markets', 'Vertical Restraints; Resale Price Maintenance; Quantity Discounts']","['D21', 'D43', 'L13', 'L42']",All-Units Discounts as a Partial Foreclosure Device,1,0,1,0,0,2018,03,01

The computational advantages of ABLP include (i) the linear approximation enables us to adopt an analytic inversion of the market share equations instead of a numerical inversion that BLP propose, (ii) ABLP solves the market share equations only at the optimum, and (iii) it minimizes over a typically small dimensional parameter space. We show that the ABLP estimator is equivalent to the BLP estimator in large data sets. Our Monte Carlo experiments illustrate that ABLP is faster than other approaches, especially for large data sets.","['Seo, Kyoungwon', 'Lee, Jinhyuk']","['Single Equation Models; Single Variables: Discrete Regression and Qualitative Choice Models; Discrete Regressors; Proportions; Probabilities', 'Large Data Sets: Modeling and Analysis']","['C25', 'C55']",A Computationally Fast Estimator for Random Coefficients Logit Demand Models Using Aggregate Data,0,0,0,0,0,2015,03,01

To address these questions, we develop two empirical entry models. In the benchmark coordinated entry model, the upstream firm sets market-specific wholesale prices and implements the first best. In the more realistic restricted/free entry model, the upstream firm only sets a uniform wholesale price. As a second-best solution, it restricts entry in markets where business stealing (encroachment) is high, and allows free entry elsewhere. We apply the model to magazine distribution, and assess the profitability of alternative vertical restraints. Banning restricted licensing reduces profits only slightly, so the business rationale for restricted licensing should not be sought in the prevention of encroachment. Furthermore, market-specific wholesale prices implement the first best, but the profit increase would be small, providing a rationale for the commonly observed uniform wholesale prices. Finally, uniform franchise fees are much less effective than a uniform wholesale price to cope with local market differences.","['Verboven, Frank', 'Ferrari, Stijn']","['Network Formation and Analysis: Theory', 'Production, Pricing, and Market Structure; Size Distribution of Firms', 'Transactional Relationships; Contracts and Reputation; Networks', 'Firm Organization and Market Structure', 'Retail and Wholesale Trade; e-Commerce', 'Entertainment; Media']","['D85', 'L11', 'L14', 'L22', 'L81', 'L82']",Vertical Control of a Distribution Network--An Empirical Analysis of Magazines,1,0,0,0,0,2012,03,01

In the absence of RPM, retail prices react to retailers' information, and deviations from collusive behavior are thus difficult to detect. By eliminating retail price flexibility, RPM facilitates the detection of deviations but reduces profits and thus increases the short-run gains from a deviation.

Without PRC, however, the problem differs significantly from a standard private provision of public goods situation. Specifically, in equilibrium, there need not be free-riding, decisions are non-monotonic in valuations, and contribution incentives are significant even in large populations. When PRC is not used, the establishment tends to favor setting low wages, which helps to select a labor force driven by concern for the firm's output. Expected output can actually fall with the wage in this situation. When wages are optimally set, the introduction of PRC, even if perfect and costless, may lower expected output and firm profits in comparison to the non-PRC outcome.","['Francois, Patrick']","['Firm Performance: Size, Diversification, and Scope', 'Personnel Management; Executives; Executive Compensation', 'Personnel Economics: Compensation and Compensation Methods and Their Effects']","['L25', 'M12', 'M52']",Making a Difference,1,0,0,0,0,2007,09,01

This is because dynamic formats allow bidders to observe the number of competitors left throughout the selling procedure.

This motivates the manufacturer to impose resale price maintenance. In a model of third-degree price discrimination by rival retailers, a retail price ceiling (or floor) enables the manufacturer to restore the first best. Imposing a fixed retail price is generally not optimal because the manufacturer wants to eliminate price discrimination based on consumers' abilities to switch retailers, not based on consumers' valuations.

Since this results in greater demand for a firm that joins the cluster, this effect increases the incentive to cluster. However, greater product heterogeneity gives stand-alone firms more local monopoly power. Since this raises their price-cost margins, this effect increases the incentive for a firm to stand alone.

With nonexclusive dealing, manufacturers face an interbrand externality because brand-enhancing investments made by one manufacturer may benefit the brands of other manufacturers. Although exclusive dealing eliminates this externality, oligopolistic manufacturers may not choose exclusive dealing. Exclusive dealing enhances the incentive to invest, but the promotional investments are a form of competition between manufacturers. Thus, manufacturers might earn higher profits with nonexclusive dealing making lower promotional investments. We find cases in which nonexclusive dealing is a dominant strategy. We also find cases in which some, but not all, manufacturers adopt exclusive dealing. Moreover, even if adoption of exclusive dealings by all manufacturers is the equilibrium, it can arise from a prisoner's dilemma in that each manufacturer would prefer nonexclusive dealing.","['Besanko, David', 'Perry, Martin K.']",['Oligopoly and Other Imperfect Markets'],['L13'],Equilibrium Incentives for Exclusive Dealing in a Differentiated Products Oligopoly,1,0,0,0,0,1993,12,01

Firms' decisions are modeled using an option pricing approach that incorporates the value of flexibility to delay or abandon projects. The article shows why rational firms invest in smaller, shorter-lead-time plants, or delay investment when faced with uncertain and asymmetric profit and loss restrictions.

Extending patent life, therefore, may not provide the innovator with increased incentives to research or to patent the innovation. In this case, the author finds that optimal patent lives are sufficiently short to discourage imitation.

When average revenue in each period is calculated as the ratio of total revenue in that period to output in the proceeding period (as in the FCC's plan for AT&T), incentives are created for the firm to engage in strategic nonlinear pricing. These incentives can lower both consumers' surplus and total surplus under price-cap regulation. They propose alternative implementations of price-cap regulation that eliminate these incentives for strategic pricing. They also examine whether current profits should influence future revisions of the cap.

The author finds that this expectation is not borne out when retrospective review is based on the firm's avoided costs. In a Joskow-type model, hindsight review mitigates the firm's tendency to build oversized risky projects, moving the firm close to the cost-minimizing level of investment. In a rate-of-return model, the firm's allowed rate of return may have to be increased to keep expected profits nonnegative. If this is done, hindsight review does not affect the firm's investment level, but it does correct the (risk-neutral) firm's tendency to pay an excessive premium to eliminate construction cost uncertainty.","['Lyon, Thomas P.']","['Economics of Regulation', 'Legal Monopolies and Regulation or Deregulation', 'Electric Utilities']","['L51', 'L43', 'L94']","Regulation with 20-20 Hindsight: 'Heads I Win, Tails You Lose'?",1,0,0,0,0,1991,12,01

If the cap applies to a price index with weights proportional to demands at uniform prices, then price discrimination benefits consumers as well as the firm. But if--perhaps more realistically--it is the firm's average revenue that is capped, then consumers prefer uniform pricing. In this case total output is higher when discrimination is allowed, which increases welfare, but marginal utilities differ across markets, which is inefficient, and the overall effect is ambiguous. A small amount of discrimination is desirable, however. It is better not to allow price discrimination if the price cap is close to the level of marginal cost.

The elasticity of demand for pay cable services is typically well in excess of unity. Also, while regulation did not lead to economically efficient (marginal cost) prices for basic cable service, it did act to keep prices below monopoly levels.

This article focuses on the interaction between these two contractual arrangements. Specifically, it is assumed that an initial contract is let competitively, with common knowledge that the winner will later become a monopolist regulated according to profit policy. Under these conditions, it is shown that expected contractor profit and government expenditure can often be reduced by raising the profit policy markup. The intuition is not only that firms ""buy in"" to the initial contracts, but also that the differential subsidization induced by profit policy (higher-cost producers receive larger absolute markups) encourages more aggressive competition. Mathematically, this seemingly restrictive regulatory setup is shown to generalize the McAfee and McMillan (1986) procurement bidding model.","['Bower, Anthony G.', 'Osband, Kent']","['Auctions', 'National Government Expenditures and Related Policies: Procurement']","['D44', 'H57']",When More Is Less: Defense Profit Policy in a Competitive Environment,0,0,1,0,0,1991,03,01

The main result is that in the presence of an upward-sloping supply curve for shares, the takeover cost to the acquirer can be greater if the target firm distributes cash through share repurchase than if it chooses either to pay a cash dividend or to do nothing. Because shareholders willing to tender in the repurchase are systematically those with the lowest valuations, the repurchase skews the distribution of remaining shareholders toward a more expensive pool. Examining the equilibrium behavior of all players in a stylized takeover game, conditions exist under which repurchase deters takeover. The example of capital gains taxation is then considered, when investors with different basis values impute different reservation values to their holding. Repurchase is more effective as a deterrent when it alters the marginal shareholder, when shareholder heterogeneity is large, and when the private benefit of control from takeover isn't too large.","['Bagwell, Laurie Simon']",['Mergers; Acquisitions; Restructuring; Voting; Proxy Contests; Corporate Governance'],['G34'],Share Repurchase and Takeover Deterrence,0,0,0,0,1,1991,03,01

35,3,2004-09-01,"As the costs of generating and transmitting information fall, the main bottlenecks in communication are becoming the human receivers, who are overloaded with information. For networks of targeted communication, I discuss the meaning of information overload, provide a theoretical treatment as the outcome of strategic interaction between senders, and examine mechanisms for allocating the attention of receivers. Such mechanisms increase the cost of sending messages and thereby shift the task of screening messages from the receivers to the senders, who know the contents of the messages. If the communication cost is low, then a tax on sending messages benefits all the senders if either the tax is redistributed to them as lump-sum transfers or their information about the receivers is sufficiently accurate.","['Van Zandt, Timothy']","['Search; Learning; Information and Knowledge; Communication; Belief; Unawareness', 'Telecommunications']","['D83', 'L96']",Information Overload in a Network of Targeted Communication,1,0,0,0,0,2004,09,01
35,3,2004-09-01,"A common thread in the theory literature on price discrimination has been the ambiguous welfare effects for consumers and the rise in profit for firms, relative to uniform pricing. In this study I resolve the ambiguity for consumers and quantify the benefit for a firm. I describe a model of price discrimination that includes both second-degree and third-degree price discrimination. Using data from a Broadway play, I estimate the structural model and conduct various experiments to investigate the implications of alternative pricing policies. The observed price discrimination may improve the firm's profit by approximately 5%, relative to uniform pricing, while the difference for aggregate consumer welfare is negligible. Also, I show that the gain from changing prices in the face of fluctuating demand is small under the observed price discrimination.","['Leslie, Phillip']","['Production, Pricing, and Market Structure; Size Distribution of Firms', 'Entertainment; Media']","['L11', 'L82']",Price Discrimination in Broadway Theater,1,0,0,0,0,2004,09,01

I consider an infinitely lived monopolist selling to a market where demand is composed of overlapping generations of forward-looking consumers. The monopolist can price differently to its previous customers than to its new customers. The new customers can either have chosen not to buy the product in the previous period or be new in the market. The main result is that, without full market coverage, the equilibrium involves cycles in the price being offered to the new customers. The monopolist is worse off than if it could not recognize its previous customers. The impact of durable goods, long-term contracts, and age recognition is also considered.","['Villas-Boas, J.

We present conditions under which equal charges for sending and receiving calls maximize welfare and profits. We also present conditions under which the receiving party's subsidizing the sender maximizes welfare and profits. Last, we show that menus of pricing options can increase welfare and profits.

The authors find that correcting for selection bias is important. Generally, small commercial establishments are not very responsive to time-of-use pricing.
